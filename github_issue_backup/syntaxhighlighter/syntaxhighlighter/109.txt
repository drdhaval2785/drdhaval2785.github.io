  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\n I am using the XML Brush (shBrushXml.js) and it was displaying the elements correctly. Suddenly I see that the elements are all displayed in the capital letters instead. \r\n\r\n I have tested in few different browsers by thinking that it could be a browser issue. However, the result is consistent across all browsers (IE, Chrome).\r\n\r\n Any Idea as to why this change happened? I don't think I have done any changes in the configuration / settings.\r\n\r\n Any help could be highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nRaghavan alias Saravanan M",

    "body": "Dear Friends,\r\n\r\n I think I have identified the problem. It is because of I had used &lt;pre&gt; tag and the XML elements were used without HTML escape characters. After reading through the installation manual, I have escaped those characters. Now it works fine. :)\r\n\r\n However, I am wondering how come it was working fine till now for a few days? :( Mystery!"
