  "body": "At least the Scala brush suffers from a case that if there is a variable called `file2` then it would highlight the number 2 from that identifier, resulting in `file` being black and `2` being green (on default theme). The expected behavior would be that the whole identifier is of the same color.\r\n\r\nHere is a quick fix for shBrushScala.js, but it would be good to check also the other brushes for similar bugs.\r\n\r\nFind:\r\n\r\n    regex: /0x[a-f0-9]+|\\d+(\\.\\d+)?/gi,\r\n\r\nReplace it with:\r\n\r\n    regex: /\\b0x[a-f0-9]+|\\b\\d+(\\.\\d+)?/gi,\r\n\r\nI'm using syntaxhighlighter 3.0.83",
