  "body": "At the moment, brush is case-sensitive - so you have to declare \"brush: php\" instead \"brush: PHP\", the proper name of the language, or \"brush: java\" instead of \"brush: Java\", for example.\r\n\r\nIt has led a lot of users to get confused about why it doesn't work - note: we're an educational institution, so they're almost-programmers, not actual programmers, who might be more aware of following instructions to the letter and the importance of case :)\r\n\r\nWould it be a huge deal to make the brush case-insensitive? It would be a huge feature from a usability standpoint.\r\n\r\nGreat plugin, by the way, and thanks :)",
