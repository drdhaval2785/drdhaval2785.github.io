    "body": "Facebook and Wordpress are older then NodeJs. They could have been written in ruby maybe.\r\nAlso, Facebook had to develop a compiler that helps them to run code fast enough, so I wouldn't say its running on pure PHP as it is.\r\n\r\nThe popularity of PHP is based on history, and it might be working on a level, other languages are better to produce better quality code, faster and easier. A great article describing the problem is: http://eev.ee/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/\r\n\r\nWhen I started web programming, I also had this opinion, and started learning PHP. Half world uses PHP, it must be good. I was wrong. I started to write a bigger project, and after a while, I started to hate it. Then I turned to ruby, and realized that ruby is much more advanced, much more modern, but already outdated.  I met a few Node applications, and my attention turned to javascript. I feel very comfortable now developing javascript, on client and on server side. Having a single scripting language on your mind is a huge advantage. And I know that there is pecl, and a lot of PHP code out there, but that comes not even close to what npm can do.\r\n\r\nMost people defending PHP are those who learned PHP and don't speak anything else. Professional programmers either use java, or javascript, ruby, perl, python, or whatever ...  \r\nProgrammers should never be afraid of learning a new language, but 90% of the web programmers are too busy with their projects and their commercial existence, and don't have time to change to a new language. As a newcomer to web programming, you don't have that problem, .. so I really recommend you to learn anything else, but not PHP. :) \r\n\r\nIn general, a new technology is usually better then an ancient technology.\r\nYou should look around twice, and decide based on your needs."

I wasn't expecting such a detailed response!\nOk, so Facebook and Wordpress are older than NodeJs... that explains\neverything i guess...\n\nI have skimmed over the article you sent me... i am being convinced that\nphp has a short life. I really liked The Analogy of the carpenters. :)\nSo here i am, learning web programming at my 29's, in a hurry to learn up\nthe faster i can, making my first steps in php, and suddenly, y realize i\nshould be learning NodeJs and not PHP. What should i do?\n\nFirst of all... i am taking a little course on php on school. Is part of\nthe whole carrer, so i have to finish it. I also work as a junior web\ndesigner/developer in a design agency, and we all use wordpress, in fact,\nthe vast majority of blogs, and content managed sites are built in\nwordpress, and the numbers are growing up every day.\n\nI doubt i could convince my boss to turn to Node... what about Wordpress?\n\ni really want to do the things the right way, but i feel a little trapped\nunder php. Why doesnt Wordpress turn to Node?\n\nDoes it make sense to learn both? how difficult could that be?\n\n-----------\n\nregarding my issue with syntax highlighter, this is what i want to achieve,\nis really simple.\n\nI want to make my own mini-site of php notes...\nI need to have quick access to all the material i am learning, and will be\nlearning...\nI figured out it would be nice, to have a sidebar, with a list of every\nfunction, and every new syntax that i learn of php.\nWhen i click on a list item (lets say 'include') i want to go to the\n'include-page.php' where i would have everything about include function.\nI could do this with html, but i would have to copy/paste the sidebar on\nevery page, that's where php was comming hanndy, but, as it turned out,\nsyntaxhiglighter doesnt work on server side....\n\ndo you think there's some way to overcame this issue?"

Or at least, some of them,...\r\nAlternatively,  you can work at your workplace and, eventually dev your own project in your own time, and choose your language and tools free. \r\n\r\nPHP will have a long life - but still, that does not make it good, and eventually you will have a shorter life if you stress about bugs too much.\r\n\r\nWordpres is wordpress, they wont rewrite it. What you can do is to look out for another CMS written in node / javascript, rails, or whatever.. but maybe the best is to brew your own, with express, bootstrap, etc, ...\r\n\r\nIf you have a boss, who dictates what to write in what language, .. you agree on your work-fee, and If you agree, you agreed. In that case your company is responsible to spend your time on effective coding, and the economic part. Lot of companies are stuck in this circle, .. my guess is that with time other companies based on newer technologies will take over, and re-implement or re-design the sites slowly, one-by one, as customers decide to change/update their sites. \r\n\r\nWhat you want to achieve, .. you can develop it yourself. I don't see a problem technically in the fact, that highlighter is client side. By the way highlight.js - another highlighting implementation has server side npm as well. ;) \r\n\r\nIf you like, take a look at ep_codepad, it is an IDE I'm developing now, and IMO the functionality you want, is already built in there.
