  "body": "When using this on a Drupal site I found that the individual code lines were displayed in block format.  The numbered lines were displayed as expected, but the actual code was being displayed in block format.\n\nThe cause of this was the base theme indicated that &lt;code&gt; tags were to be displayed in block format.  To override this I had to add the following to the end of shThemeDefault.css\n\n.syntaxhighlighter .code code {\n    display: inline;\n}\n\nThis forced the individual lines of code to display inline instead of block format.\n\n",
