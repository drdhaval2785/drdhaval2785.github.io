  "body": "Trying to use syntaxhighlighter and can't figure out a few questions.\r\n\r\nAt first, the help button doesn't actually show the «About» information, it only displays a placeholder. I've cloned repo and ran build, as described in build/README.txt. I expected it had to generate correct about window, but there is still a placeholder. Do I miss something?\r\n\r\nAlso, can I configure toolbar to add my own controls without editing core js? Is toolbar configurable from the outside?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.",
