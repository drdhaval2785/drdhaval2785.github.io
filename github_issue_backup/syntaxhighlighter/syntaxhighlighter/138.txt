  "body": "I may be using the Node build script incorrectly so I apologize in advance if I'm sticking my foot in my mouth. :-)  \n\nWhen I use the build script, the @ABOUT@ variable was not being replaced in my final output file. In digging through the build.js file, I discovered the line:\n\n    var files = glob(outputDir, '**.js').concat(glob(outputDir, '**.css'));\n\nWhen I did a console.log for the value of \"files\", it returned empty.\n\nI rewrote it as:\n\n    var files = glob(outputDir, '**');\n\nThe compiled file now does the variable replacement. I realize that it's now processing ALL the files in the output directory, not just the JS and CSS files. I haven't figured out how to do the limiting of files that was intended by the original line yet though. \n",
