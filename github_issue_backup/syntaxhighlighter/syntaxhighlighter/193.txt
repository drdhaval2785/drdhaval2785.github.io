I have some more stuff to do before I make a new pull request but this uses your syntax highlighting engine to highlight code on the command line in a shell terminal. It's very handy for those who work in a UNIX'y environment or on MacOS. I also have some updates to push to you about a proper syntax highlighting for JSON. I just have been busy with work at Netflix."
