  "body": "Hey \r\n\r\nI currently run a blog that I built myself but have an issue with syntaxhighlighter. \r\n\r\nI can relate it down to this line of code \r\n\r\n $article = strtr($article, array(\"\\r\\n\" => '<br />', \"\\r\" => '<br />', \"\\n\" => '<br />'));\r\n\r\nI use this so that each enter is returned as a new line in the article rather than writing <p> for each new line. \r\nThis unfortunately breaks the code of SH, it displays everything on the one line and where a line break should be it places <br> instead. \r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone else had this problem / a fix \r\n\r\nThanks for your help.
