  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI was recently writing a tutorial on my website, only to find when publishing it that the syntax highlighting had really screwed up (for some reason unknown to me).\r\nAs can be demonstrated, here: http://www.dev-hq.net/7-Javascript/54-If-and-Else-statements\r\nUsing strings that are created using single quotes (apostrophes) inside a function, seems to really mess up the JScript SyntaxHighlighting. Like so:\r\n\r\n<pre class=\"brush: js;\">\r\nvar name = prompt('What is your name?');\r\nif(name=='Joe') //If the user's name is 'Joe'\r\n{\r\n\talert('Wow, cool â€“ my name is Joe too!');\r\n}\r\nelse if(name=='Fred') //If the user's name is 'Fred'\r\n{\r\n\talert('Fred is a pretty generic name...');\r\n}\r\nelse if(name=='John') //If the user's name is 'John'\r\n{\r\n\talert('Alright, John?');\r\n}\r\nelse if(name=='George') //If the user's name is 'George'\r\n{\r\n\talert('George is a pretty decent name.');\r\n}\r\nelse\r\n{\r\n\talert('I have no opinion on your name.');\r\n}\r\n</pre>",

    "body": "I get a similar issue with the SQL brush, and I think it might be due to unbalanced apostrophes in comments.\r\n\r\nFor instance, in the following snippet, disobeying the comment and deleting the final `&#039;` means the keywords in the string literals are highlighted incorrectly.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n  <pre class=\"brush: sql\">\r\n  -- Don&#039;t be deleting that final &#039;\r\n  SELECT &#039;Hello, &#039; AS line1\r\n       , &#039;I am going to delete&#039; AS line2\r\n       , &#039;your data now.&#039; AS line3\r\n  FROM dual\r\n  </pre>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I change all the `user's` to `users` in your comments above the syntax highlighting works for me, suggesting this may be the same issue in the JScript brush."
