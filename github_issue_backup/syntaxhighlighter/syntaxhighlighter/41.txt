  "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nWhen you have code with entities, like &amp;, the brush receives &amp; instead of just. In the case of Clojure it breaks because the ; at the end of it matches starting a comment, so we end up with &;, with the ; highligted as comment. I found a workaround but I think this is a bug, right? I'll post a link to the workaround once it's public.\r\n\r\nIn Chrome at least, even if the code just has a single ampersand: &, the brush ends up receiving the entity &amp;.",
