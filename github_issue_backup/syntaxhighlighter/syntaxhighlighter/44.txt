The new copy method does not work well on all\r\ncode area's and also how the regular user will know how to do that unless you post information above each code\r\nblock \"Double click inside the code to select\".\r\nThank you",

    "body": "+1, I found out after reading a little deeper that the toolbar was purposely out of v3 (your demo page[1] is misleading :)) - it also seems like there is a discrepancy, without looking at the code, what exactly toolbar is supposed to do in v3 now. It seems to only add the little \"about\" help icon thing.\r\n\r\nI went back to v2 for now, because I really enjoy that.\r\n\r\n[1] http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/manual/demo/toolbar.html\r\n"
