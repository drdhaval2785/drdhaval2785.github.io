I've added them to the basic/default css\r\n3rd: I've added a README pointing out that you cannot run SH from the source repo .. did cost me half hour\r\n4th: It's a big PITA that the build system requires PHP5 and Java, which delayed me for another half-hour, since we don't have such crap on our servers. All because I wanted to contribute back those trivial changes;)\r\nAnyway, rant over, pls merge",
