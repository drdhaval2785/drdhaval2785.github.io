  "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nIn the version available from the dokuwiki website (installation via plugin downloader), there's a bug regarding a \r\n\r\n    vertical-align: baseline\r\n\r\nin the code.\r\n\r\nIt works in Chromium but it causes all the lines of code to be shifted by about half a line in Firefox. Removing it solve the problem.\r\n\r\nI have also a bootstrap based theme, maybe it's a conflict between the two CSS files, I didn't checked it much.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need more infos.\r\n\r\nThanks",
