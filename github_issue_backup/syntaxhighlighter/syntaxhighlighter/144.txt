  "body": "I am experiencing some issues with a custom brush I've made for [AutoIt](http://www.autoitscript.com/site/) script.\n\nThe problem appears to be with semi-colons being used as a comment marker, and possibly something to do with the encoding of markup characters (e.g. \">\" to \"&gt;\").\n\nI know nothing about the inner workings of the SyntaxHighlighter, but at a glance, these are the symptoms that I recognize.\n\n*EDIT: Removed edit query string param from URL. All apologies; didn't notice when I posted it.*\n\nHere is an example of what I'm referring to: http://forum.nekoyoubi.com/posting.php?f=6&t=2&p=2\n\n*EDIT: As stated below, the following is no longer the case, as I've since altered the brush to 'hack' around the problem. Please note the behavior in lines 18, 19, and 20, however, as I have adjusted them to display the hacked issue instead.*\n\nYou'll see that on line 18, there is a random semi-colon that jumps in right after the \"<\". This semi-colon is not present in the data, obviously, but renders every time in the display. If I change it to a \">\" is does the same.\n\nNot that I think it matters at all, but the custom brush, in case I've done something wrong there, is available here: http://forum.nekoyoubi.com/js/syntaxhighlighter3/brushes/shBrushAutoIt.js\n\nThanks much in advance for any and all assistance in resolving this issue.",

I'm guessing this has something to do with that \"mode=edit\" in your query string (are you sending us to a page to edit your post?).  don't think you're going to get anybody to register an account on your forums just so they can view an example of your problem. I'd suggest creating a gist with your example."

I had extracted them from the Scite syntaxt file; just never got them into the brush.\n\nNo, registering was never a part of the deal, I merely copy-pasta'd that URL and unfortunately didn't look before I posted. Thanks for the catch.\n\nAs I posted in my second message, however, I've since \"resolved\" the issue with a faulty hack that you can see now if you look at lines 18, 19, and 20. I left the issue open because even though I can force the hack to work in all cases (since it's comments that are the issue), having the HTML encoded characters (the markup; not the render) effect the syntax highlighting at all seems like a flaw that someone may want to address.\n\nIf I am wrong in that and should close this issue, just let me know. Thanks! "
