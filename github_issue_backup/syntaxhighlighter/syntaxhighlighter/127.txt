    "body": "The solution for this is for @alexgorbatchev to merge pull request #121, which adds XRegExp 2.0.0 and makes some other necessary tweaks.\n\nUntil that's done, there are two different ways you can address this. You can either include the patches I submitted in #121 in your own copy of the repository, or you can simply run the following line of JavaScript after loading XRegExp 2.0.0 and before loading SyntaxHighlighter:\n\n~~~js\nXRegExp.install('natives');\n~~~\n\nThat overrides native regex methods with extended versions as was done automatically in v1.5.1. If you include the patches in the pull request I referenced, you don't need that line."
