During running dev branch, I fix some running issue in passing. The compatibility problem is that gutter was hidden when I double click the code under IE10, even blur still not bring it back.Here's the screenshots.\r\n\r\n![normal](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3940642/1907165/5500b17e-7cc3-11e3-9edd-d89fe696e5c6.png)\r\n![after double clicked](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3940642/1907166/55321764-7cc3-11e3-9e4b-6970b3ea23f1.png)\r\n![after blur](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3940642/1907167/555a3924-7cc3-11e3-8b79-e1e47e372fd8.png)\r\n\r\nBTW, you shuold add a notice \"Please install git first.\" for dev branch.\r\n\r\nHere is the package for test.\r\n![syntaxhighlighter_3 0 83](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/3940642/1907443/2526aab2-7ccd-11e3-8c12-80c1ff0159bd.jpg)\r\ndownload it and change suffix to .7z, then you can unzip it.\r\n\r\nI only modified index.html for test.\r\n\r\nUpdate: 2014-01-14 11:40:38 in Beijing Time\r\nI found out that origin index.html has no problem. Is it my use method wrong?\r\n\r\nUpdate: 2014-01-14 11:53:52 in Beijing Time\r\nI think I figure it out. Because of too many code in a line, textarea was enlarged to cover the gutter."
