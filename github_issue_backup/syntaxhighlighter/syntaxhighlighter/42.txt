  "body": "I added a visual test for the diff brush and fixed a few issues:\r\n\r\n* colorize location/context markers that include function name\r\n* make file name match more specific by including a space (similar to #40 - not sure which is better)\r\n* #31 - simplify diff line regexp to colorize more correctly more often\r\n\r\nFor the most part matching was simplified but I believe it is correct in more cases.\r\n\r\nI also changed the default colors to red for deletions and green for additions.\r\nGreen deletions seem counter-intuitive, and the blue color seemed non-obvious to me.\r\nI understand they are still at the whim of the themes,\r\nbut I think it's an improvement for the defaults.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?  Do you have an example that is not covered by these changes?\r\n\r\nSorry to bombard you with so many pull requests lately,\r\nbut I've been working on metacpan.org and have been trying to swat issues reported there\r\nand send them back upstream to you to help out and confirm that the changes are on the right track.\r\n\r\nYou've done some great work and we appreciate using it!\r\nThanks!",
