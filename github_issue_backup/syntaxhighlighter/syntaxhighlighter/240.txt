    "body": "Same issues here. The cause of the Windows jake problem seems to be the `mkdir` function in build/build.coffee:37, where `dir` is initialized to \"/\" and the path.join loop that comes next prepends it resulting in the extra c:\\ that throws the ENOENT. Setting `dir` to an empty string brings Windows building to the missing components error, but the scss files will still compile to css (which is what I needed at the time)."
