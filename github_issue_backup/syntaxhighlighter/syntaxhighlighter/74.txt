  "body": "Would it be possible for someone to add the PHPDoc comment to the PHP brush.  so something like\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n    * @author Kenneth Davis\r\n    * @copyright 2011\r\n    */\r\n\r\nWould wrap the `@author` and `@copyright` inside of a `.phpdoc` css class.  \r\n\r\n`@author` and `@copyright` could be pretty much any word with the `@` in front of it inside a comment\r\n\r\nUpdate... I have almost got it done but I ran into a problem. I add something like this to my PHP brush file...\r\n\r\n     // PHPDoc Comment Variables \r\n    { regex: /@[a-z]+/g,      css: 'php-phpdoc phpdoc' },\r\n\r\nBut then on the shCore.js file on line 1318 is a function the says...\r\n                /**\r\n        \t * Checks to see if any of the matches are inside of other matches. \r\n        \t * This process would get rid of highligted strings inside comments, \r\n        \t * keywords inside strings and so on.\r\n        \t */\r\n        \tremoveNestedMatches: function(matches)\r\n\r\nthis seem to strip out my matched PHPDoc match, would love a fix for this if possible",
