You can see it happen here when using Chrome 16.0.912.75\r\n\r\nhttp://modxrevo.datawebnet.com.au/formitbuilder-complex-example\r\n\r\nAny assistance appreciated. Not sure if this is a Chrome problem or a Syntax Highlighter problem. If you mouse down and drag to select the code it does copy correctly. If you select all, tripple click etc,  the spaces get copied incorrectly.\r\nCant seem to reproduce in any other browser.\r\n"

Probably fair enough since nbsp is useful for the layout of the code, but no so great for copying and pasting from the text area. I've just committed a fix to my fork and added a pull request: https://github.com/alexgorbatchev/SyntaxHighlighter/pull/86\r\n\r\nLove syntax highlighter :-)"
