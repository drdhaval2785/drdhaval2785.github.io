    "body": "Function name can easily be changed. Micro-optimization argument is however inaccurate. While for a single parsing one might save few to a hundred bytes, on pages which are viewed thousands of times this quickly amounts to much larger values. It might be negligible and a non-issue, saying there's no benefit is not true. Any decent server hosting hundreds of sites with a fairly average view count will have significant increase in bandwidth use which could be used in a smarter way.\r\n\r\nWith availability of developer tools in all major browsers, reading page source is impractical. Adding line breaks for readability from page source not only wastes bandwidth but valuable CPU time as well. Not to mention use of double quotes in PHP is significantly slower due to parsing support. \r\n\r\nBesides, am not arguing for the change of default behavior, rather having ability to optimize should one desire to do so. For my company, time-to-first-byte is important and considering page speed still affects ranking in Google I very much care for every millisecond I can save."

That's just waste of resources. Instead it should be generated without newlines. I would be happy to modify my pull request which removes all the new line characters added to output code. That would be ideal solution as less operations would be needed and produced code would be smaller."
