    "body": "I like this in theory... Are we expecting the user to modify the parsedown.php and include whatever code they want to use as a pre-processor? That could prove problematic for upgrades. I think it would make more sense as a call back. Something along the lines of:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$p = new Parsedown();\r\n$cb = \"NS::MyFunc\";\r\n$p->setPreProcessorCallback($cb);\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can then check if the callback `isCallable()` and if so, run it. This allows extrapolation between the Parsedown code and external modifiers. Thoughs?"
