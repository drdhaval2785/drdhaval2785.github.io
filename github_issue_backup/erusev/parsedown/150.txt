  "body": "You probably won't like this but we'll try ... :-)\r\n\r\nI have a use case where I have a folder of MD files. I want to convert them to a folder of HTML files. So far so good - a simple PHP script with your library has done the job.\r\n\r\nBut there are times where one markdown file wants to link to another markdown file. When we convert to HTML, we don't want to link to the MD, we want to link to the associated HTML.\r\n\r\nSo basically on converting MD to HTML, I want to rewrite URLs slightly.\r\n\r\nHopefully I've come up with a nice solution .... I didn't want to add URL rewriting into Parsedown - instead I thought let's provide some hooks that other programmers can call to do what they want in terms of extending the functionality without adding to the complexity of the original class.\r\n\r\nAdd a function getHTMLForLink() which takes params and generates HTML. Parsedown class then calls that to generate any HTML. The changes to your class are minimal, the API is the same, all tests pass.\r\n\r\nI can then extend the Parsedown class, override the getHTMLForLink() method and do URL rewriting in there. ",

    "body": "I simplified slightly; I'm also moving some of the folders around. But this is the beauty of just putting in a hook - users can do what they like without adding new features into core :-)\r\n\r\nOther thing I'm gonna try is generating h1, h2 tags as a separate function. Reason is, I have a h1 in the HTML already - so when I generate MD to HTML I want the header1 in the MD to be a h2 in HTML, the header2 in the MD to be a h3 in HTML and so on. Again, I think a hook is the way to go!"
