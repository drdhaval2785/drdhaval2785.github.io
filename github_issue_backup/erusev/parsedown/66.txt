If nothing, it will save developers few seconds from typing one more space character.\r\n\r\nI know the spec says linebreaks are created with two or more spaces but you could make it with one or more. Having two spaces producing empty line isn't that important. This will preserve backward compatibility.",

    "body": "I think adding one space after a line is not supported because this can easily happen when working with text and you might not want to have a linebreak. consider you have text `this is a long line, hello world` and you will set cursor before world and press enter to move it to the next line for better readability (text fits your screen). You do not want a line break here and do not see the space in normal editor. This would be hard to debug. I guess this is the reason for having two or more spaces needed for linebreak."
