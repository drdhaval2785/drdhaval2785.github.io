    "body": "I'll share my extended opinion on this one.\r\n\r\n@rk initially stated:\r\n\r\n> I'm not using a git submodule, so to track updates I have to check tags / releases.\r\n\r\nWho said anything about using a git submodule? This would not be my recommendation in any case. You should use [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) as stated in the readme.\r\n\r\nRegarding tracking tags / releases. This is a good practice. You need to check the changes between releases. But you don't need to do it constantly. You just need to check them before you are updating to a new minor or major version. Not a patch version. It's best to see your current version in your `composer.lock` file and compare it to the latest stable release on github. Like so: https://github.com/erusev/parsedown/compare/0.4.6...0.7.6\r\n\r\nIf there are breaking changes they should be visible there or in the release notes.\r\n\r\nBut how would you know if there is a new version? `composer show erusev/parsedown` is a good way.\r\n\r\nIf you want to get notified for new releases you could use [VersionEye](https://www.versioneye.com).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n@ckdarby \r\n\r\n> Lets say I make a solid pull request, everything looks awesome, it is good functionality, etc but I didn't update the header version and now that pull request is going to sit there until I come back & deal with a single line change.\r\n\r\nYou should never update the version in a PR. Actually nobody should update the version in a normal commit. Version should be updated only after actually committing changes, pushing (to master), wait for the CI results and in general make sure everything is fine. Only then you could create one of those \"bump version\" commits and after that tag this commit.\r\n\r\n> So, you're going to have to diff from the last version to this version, get a list of all the modified files and then update those headers to the new version. You won't be able to use a find & replace across all the code because that means anyone who diff's between the versions will see every file modified.\r\n\r\nParsedown consists basically of one file. And even if it didn't you should have the version on one place only. There is no point of keeping version numbers in every file and updating them every time everywhere.\r\n\r\n> Lets say you just released 0.8..\r\nA couple days later you notice that you forgot to update the version in the header of a file.\r\n\r\nAs I pointed above you shouldn't create a tag, before bumping the version. You could use a simple release script which updates the version and creates a tag.\r\n\r\n> That would mean you're now going to add a single commit with a one line modification to update that file you forgot and when I run composer update it is going to tell me that this project updated and I'm going to diff to see a single line modification.\r\n\r\nIf you've followed the steps I've described you would see this problem would not be possible.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, IMHO having a version number in the header is not needed for this project. Indeed it will create too much hurdles for the maintainer. Even if the release script is a one-line bash file, the parser would be quite fine without it.\r\n\r\nI just hope my thoughts would help someone.\r\n\r\nTry keeping to the best practices:\r\n- Use Composer.\r\n- Keep an eye on the releases and the release notes.\r\n- Use git and tags for comparing.\r\n- Use VersionEye if new versions of the software are crucial to you.\r\n\r\nSeparating source code and meta is good.\r\n\r\nA Packagist badge or a simple line saying: \"Latest stable version: **0.8.5**\" is enough."

You should use Composer as stated in the readme.\r\n\r\nIt's too bad that Composer would be too much technical overhead to put into the project that I'm using Parsedown in. I'd like to use it, but when I got started over a year ago the documentation was very anemic and the community around Composer just didn't exist. Now, due to time/resources the client wouldn't authorize the fairly major restructuring a switch to Composer would entail. And I'm not justifying that for 1 dependency. So, I've been using git submodules (and their own headaches) as the next best thing. And because Parsedown is just a single file I didn't bother to add to my headaches of tracking yet another submodule across branches.\r\n\r\nI have to tag the header by hand just to know the version for myself whenever I update the library. And I'm pretty sure I won't be the only one. Face it, we're not talking about NPM or RubyGems here—Composer is still a newbie and isn't even out of alpha yet (IMO alpha5 probably should be beta1, but whatever). Adoption is too low to assume that *only* Composer projects will use your library. It might be convenient for the maintainer, but it's a flawed assumption nonetheless.\r\n\r\n> In conclusion, IMHO having a version number in the header is not needed for this project. Indeed it will create too much hurdles for the maintainer.\r\n\r\nToo many hurdles for the maintainer? If prepping a release by hand is hard enough, you'd have to only update both package.json and parsedown.php, commit, then run `git tag -a`. How's this difficult? Without a version number in the header he'll be writing the version number twice at least, and it's easy to automate the entire process with bash. (I'm no bash wizard, and even I could do it.)\r\n\r\nAs you, yourself, admitted it is a common convention to place the version number in the header of the main file of a library.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nWhatever @erusev decides is fine with me.\r\n\r\nI asked because I knew I wouldn't be the only person working on an older project without Composer support. I honestly don't see how this could become such a debate over adding ~7 bytes to the comment header just to track the library's version."
