  "body": "The `inlineSpecialCharacter` method is replacing `\"` characters with `&quot;` characters, but this is limits how the output is processed through other text modifiers. Mainly, in my case, running the text through SmartyPants. Because straight double-quotes are entities, SmartyPants won't process them into \"smart\" curly quotes.\r\n\r\nI know that converting `\"` into `&quot;` isn't really a bug, it's more a feature that's getting in my way for later. I guess my question is — how necessary is this conversion to an entity for the rest of the code? Is other code relying on straight-double-quotes already being escaped?",
