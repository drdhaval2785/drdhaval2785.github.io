  "body": "Today I integrated your parser with [Caracal](http://caracal.way2cu.com) and already loving the how extensible it is and speed improvement over old parser. Caracal is also [open source](https://github.com/Way2CU/Caracal) so anyone should be free to take a look what we do with it. Right now I am re-implementing our image specific URL handling, but soon plan on supporting many different extensions.\r\n\r\nEdit: [Example how we are starting to use it.](https://github.com/Way2CU/Caracal/blob/develop/units/markdown.php)",
