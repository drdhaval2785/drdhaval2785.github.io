It would probably hurt performance as not only emails but every inline HTML tag would have to go through it.\r\n\r\n- The obfuscation should produce unpredictable output.\r\n\r\n  Here's a quote from the spec:\r\n\r\n  > Automatic links for email addresses work similarly, except that Markdown will also perform a bit of randomized decimal and hex entity-encoding to help obscure your address from address-harvesting spambots.\r\n\r\nI pushed a partial implementation of the feature and there are a bunch of commits on top of it so I'd not be merging this but I appreciate your contribution and I hope I'll see more pull requests from you."

I was using Michel Fortin's Markdown parsers for kirby cms so far, but I was always looking for a faster more compact alternative.
