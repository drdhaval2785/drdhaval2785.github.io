That's the reason it is an option and off by default. \r\n\r\nThanks for the clarification. I think you are 100% correct that line breaks are no longer part of GFM as [per this](https://help.github.com/articles/writing-on-github):\r\n\r\n> written using GitHub Flavored Markdown **along with some additional features** to make writing content on GitHub easy.\r\n\r\nClosing this issue.\r\n\r\n>> obviously not named the same as that would introduce all kinds of issues for existing users\r\n\r\n>What do you mean?\r\n\r\nI meant, if github line breaks were to be the default behavior, this would mean that there would need to be an option to enable vanilla MD line breaks. That would probably work something like:\r\n\r\n```php\r\n$parser = new Parsedown();\r\n$parser->setBreaksAfterSpaceEnabled();\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou'd essentially want to rename the method so as not to conflict with setBreaksEnabled() during the deprecated/transition period. But that's a moot point."
