You are the only person running the show. Before the know how of how to run the Cologne dictionaries as admin is lost, please put it at appropriate repository on Github, so that the show may go on in future. Otherwise the codes on Hard disk may die one day with no hope of revival. Github may ensure the dissemination as well as updation of codes by so many interested scholars. What say?\r\nAnd don't forget to put a readme of how to use the pythons too. So that people don't end up reinventing the wheel and recreating the codes. \r\n\r\nWith regards,\r\nDhaval",

    "body": "@drdhaval2785 I do not think it's a question of \"do not forget\". You know yourself on the 2nd year of coding of our php devanagari sorting scripts, that the documentation is lagging behind badly. To document it all would take several weeks of documenting only work, because screenshots, research in books would be wanted. So it's about priorities. If Jim would only document his \"dirty laundy\" we would not see not implementation of corrections, no new releases, no nothing. Just some huge readme files, because you know - when Jim documents something, it's a Bible that has a changelog on every word added to it and I absolutely adore the approach.\r\nBut yes, I worry about the Cologne dictionaries as much, the more after Malcolm left us. Being realistic we all understand, that in 1 or 20 years Jim might consider converting to some other job or better worlds, and Cologne could become non-updatable, just one more dead Sanskrit resources out there. That is why I created this place. The only thing I ask is to have some `trash` place where everything would be uploaded, undocumented, as it is now, so we would get out clean laundry later with Jim's help out of. House of serpents, home of pythons. Nor Peter, nor I are coders. But there is Dhaval, there will be people to continue the work. That is what worries me a lot indeed. Because the amount of work already put in this work is non comparable to other online efforts on Sanskrit, Sanskrit lexicography in special.\r\n\r\nBecause as James Nye, the gatekeeper at http://dsal.uchicago.edu/dictionaries/ wrote just a few days before:\r\n\r\n`Thank you for letting me know about the error.  We will make that change, although it may be several months before the corrected data is available for public view.  This is because of our limited staffing.`\r\n\r\nAnd you start valuing Jim's 3 day update implementation cycle a lot for dozens of mistakes when you know there is 6 month cycle out there for a single mistake."

    "body": "Yes, I have thought about this issue a lot and agree it is important.  \r\n\r\nOne partial solution is to make use of the Downloads for each dictionary.  This has much of the critical information required to keep projects alive. The advantage is that you ( @drdhaval2785 and @gasyoun ) can do this now.  \r\n\r\nA second partial solution was attempted a month or so ago by Ralph Bunker, a computer expert who has long worked with Peter.  He essentially downloaded to a hosted computer all the downloads, so all the Cologne displays would be duplicated.  This is good, but there is no good way (yet) for him to keep this up to date,  Also, what he has is probably hidden from general view.\r\n\r\nIf we count all the scans and pdfs, there is probably 50-75GB of space involved (I probably can get a fairly close estimate of this by some program).\r\n\r\nExcluding the scans and pdfs,  there is probably 3-5GB (100MB of digitizations and code per 30+ dictionaries) of space required.\r\n\r\nI've thought about the idea of developing a 'mirror' site at some hosting service (such as AWS, Rackspace) that we could all have access to.  There are several obstacles, notably lack of sysadmin skills.   Key to such a mirror site would be that it be kept 'in sync' with Cologne.  I would be glad to pay for such a site, if I knew technically how to set things up.\r\n\r\nSpecific, practical, technically-detailed suggestions are needed to make this a reality.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "@funderburkjim \r\nAs you have noted down the possible candidates for storage, let me try to add my comments on them.\r\n```\r\n* Plans:\r\n1. Currently, my plan is to copy the scans for the other dictionaries to the\r\ns3://sanskrit-lexicon/scans bucket.\r\nI estimate the total space that would be used is about 10GB.\r\n2. I may copy various programs and data as zipped blobs to this bucket:\r\n**Unzipped**, the sizes are\r\na. 2GB all digitizations in 'orig' directories\r\nb. 10GB pywork directories\r\nc. 2GB web directories, excluding pdfpages directories.\r\nd. 3GB mwupdate\r\n2a. Alternatively, I may try to reorganize the code (since code for\r\none dictionary A is quite similar (but not identical) to that for\r\nanother dictionary B.\r\n3. I haven't decided whether to save backups of certain things:\r\na. 10GB downloads of bookmarked pdfs\r\nb. 11GB zip downloads (Xtxt.zip, Xxml.zip, Xweb.zip)\r\n```\r\n1. Fine.\r\n2/2a - Please go for 2 and not 2a. The reason is that whatever minor modifications are there in other dictioaries, it will take years to do so for a person other than you. So not an option to go for 2a. Store 2 as it is in Cologne for now. If you reorganise the code and reduce the size, do so at a later stage.\r\n3a,3b - A good idea to store them also. Otherwise we will have to come all the way to USA to search for your hard drive one day."
