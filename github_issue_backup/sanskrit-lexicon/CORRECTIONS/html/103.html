<br/><code>Why some are in () only?</code>  All suggestions, whether in parens or no,  are words in some dictionary that are<br/>
<br/>   within a certain edit distance of the word in question (samudragupwa in case 001 of pgn-fuzzyalpha.txt).
<br/>   samudragupta is a word in some dictionary which has a close spelling to samudragupwa,  so<br/>
<br/>   sumdragupta qualifies as a suggestion.   NOW  imagine we have a list of all suggestions <em>based on edit
<br/>   distance</em> criterion.   This list is further analyzed into two sublists, based on the preceding and succeeding
<br/>   headword  (in case 001 of PGN,  the preceding headword is candragupta, and the following headword is
<br/>   also candragupta -  unusual they are the same.)   If a given suggestion is alphabetically between the
<br/>   preceeding and following headword, then that suggestion goes in non-parenthesized list;  if the suggestion
<br/>   fails to be alphabetically between, then that suggestion goes in the parenthesized list.<br/>
<br/><code>Why some () are empty?</code>    There are no suggestions that are NOT in alphabetical order.  E.g., in case 003
<br/>   there is just one suggestion Suklakarmman  and it is alphabetically between ruzwaSarmman and<br/>
<br/>   suSarmman,  so Suklakarmman   was put outside (), and there was no other suggestion that could go in
<br/>   ()
<br/><code>Should we have such a big fuzzy distance?</code>   There is no easy answer to this question.  The edit-distance
<br/>  maximum edit distance parameter used in the PGN fuzzyalpha.py program was 6.   This generates some
<br/>  false positives (bad suggestions).    I don't know if there is a 'best' edit distance threshold.  </p>

          <p>There is two other details of the suggestion generation that is incorporated in fuzzyalpha.py.<br/>
<br/> Suppose that the fuzzy distance parameter is set to 6.   And suppose our base word is X (like samudragupwa<br/>
<br/> is case 001 of PGN).  Our initial pool of candidates for suggestions, Y, is all 300,000+ words in sanhw1.txt. </p>
<pre><code>    <br/>* An accepted suggestion Y must have the same first letter as X  (e.g., Y must start with 's') 
    <br/>* Once we have the set S of all words Y which have the same first letter as X and whose edit distance from 
    <br/>   X is <=6,  then this suggestion list is further reduced to include only those Y in S which have the minimum 
    <br/>   edit distance from X.   To elaborate:  Suppose the edit distances from X happen to be 3 for some Y in S, 
    <br/>   4 for some other Y in S, and 6 for other Y in S.   Then the FINAL suggestion list will only include those  
    <br/>   Y with edit distance of 3. 
    <br/>The first condition was chosen to provide some computational efficiency. 
    <br/>The second condition was chosen as a way to prune the list of suggestions (so that list would not be too long). 
    <br/>These choices could be debated,  but, for our purposes in generating correction suggestions they seem to  
    <br/>be plausible. </p>

<br/>1) <code>words in some dictionary</code> why not link to it? why not add info where it comes from? That can help in the decision making. Knowing the background helps at least me.
<br/>2) <code>suggestion is alphabetically between the preceeding and following headword, then that suggestion goes in non-parenthesized list</code> I hope Dhaval got it because I hardly.
<br/>3) <code>edit-distance maximum edit distance parameter used in the PGN fuzzyalpha.py program was 6</code> - can we recreate the files with 5,4,3,2,1? 1 seems to give fine results, see <a href="https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/45#issuecomment-92873646">https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/45#issuecomment-92873646</a>
<br/>4) <code>all 300,000+ words in sanhw1.txt</code> -> all 430k. Feel the difference between 300 and 430k.
<br/>5) <code>same first letter as X</code> - what about the a+X, an+X (in the beginning of the word) variations, should not we include them as well? Maybe PD dirt can be cleaned because of it?</p>

          <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/gasyoun" target="_blank">@gasyoun</a></strong> Re 5). PD
<br/>I've generated pd-fuzzyalpha , 1158 cases.  Review of a random selection of these makes me think that
<br/> THERE ARE ALMOST NO ERRORS.   Rather,  I suspect these cases are simply due to the great number
<br/>of compound words in PD that do not appear in MW.  Take <code>agnicEtanya</code> as an example.  Both <code>agni</code> and
<br/><code>cEtanya</code> are words appearing in MW, but the compound word does not appear, and the <code>icE</code> sequence
<br/>appearing in this compound does not appear in any MW word.
<br/>I think a different approach should be used to examine this PD faultfinder list.  The reason is that 1158 cases
<br/>is, practically speaking, a large list to check manually against scans.
<br/>One different approach would be for
<br/>one of our Sanskrit experts simply to read each word in the list and judge whether the word is <em>obviously</em> a
<br/>correct Sanskrit word (I suspect this will be true in 90% of the cases), or whether the word needs further
<br/>examination.  Then, the words marked for further examination can be examined 'manually' by comparison
<br/>to the scanned images.
<br/>Another possible approach would be to write a program to identify  the words which are (like agnicEtanya)
<br/>compounds of MW headwords.  Here's how the program could work. The program could successively try
<br/>all 2-fold partitions of the word, for instance<br/>
<br/>a+gnicEtanya, ag + nicEtanya, agn+icEtanya, agni+cEtanya, agnic+Etanya  ... agnicEtany + a
<br/>and, for a given partition, check if both components are MW headwords.  If so, the given word would be
<br/>marked as OK.   The remaining words (those not marked as OK) would need further review, either by
<br/>Sanskrit experts, or manually by comparison to scan.
<br/>Note: This mechanical partition is simple-minded, that's why it would be a good first thing to try. One weakness of the mechanical partition approach is that it does not take into account sandhi that can occur
<br/>in compounds when combining nominal stems.  For instance, the word <code>akzIRendu</code> occurs among the<br/>
<br/>1158 PD cases.  This is likely a compound of akzIRa and indu, (both MW stems) but this fact would not
<br/>be found by the mechanical partition approach. </p>

          <p><strong><a href="https://github.com/funderburkjim" target="_blank">@funderburkjim</a></strong> the non-appearance of <code>agnicEtanya</code> in MW is understood. PD initial goal was to list all the possible combinations, MW wanted to keep the bricks separately so he has only <code>agni</code> and <code>cEtanya</code>. At the end of the day PD failed and the dictionary will be never finished. As a part of the initial goal in Pune I plan to print the total index of all the 430k wordforms found in Sanskrit dictionaries to see if it has any practical usage.
<br/>1k+ cases is a list too big indeed, just to test.
<br/><code>One different approach</code> does not makes sense - it would bring as to the Bronze Age (pre-2014). It would make sense only if <strong><a href="https://github.com/drdhaval2785" target="_blank">@drdhaval2785</a></strong> would create a sister to his sandhi generator and analyze the words and mark the ones which are fishy at least from the phonetics standpoint.<br/>
<br/><code>Another possible approach</code> seems to be more promising. The fact is such a program is already written and used at <a href="http://sanskrit.inria.fr/MW/90.html#ciraprasuutaa">http://sanskrit.inria.fr/MW/90.html#ciraprasuutaa</a> In 2013 Gérard Huet wrote: <code>I know how to split arbitrary compounds. So the lexicalized entries do not matter that much, except for looking up their definitions, of course.</code>
<br/>It's too bad Huet's code is closed, he said it took them 6 months to make the <code>mechanical partition is simple-minded</code> process with Pawan Goyal a little more smarter. The sandhi part is rather stupid in Huet's splitting of samasas as well, actually. This is where <strong><a href="https://github.com/drdhaval2785" target="_blank">@drdhaval2785</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://github.com/mbykov" target="_blank">@mbykov</a></strong> code could come handy.</p>
