          <p>In MW, several records were modified by adding markup so the headwords would be recognized as roots; here's the markup:
<br/><code> <br/><vlex type=\"root"></vlex> <br/></code>
<br/>In these cases, generally MW indicates a variant spelling of some other root.
<br/>Here are the roots; in this listing, the word to the right of the arrow is the MW headword that was
<br/>added as a root;  the word to the left is the Wilson headword believed to correspond to the MW headword.
<br/><code> <br/>018 krunTa <-> krunT   (added as MW verb) <br/>019 klapa <-> klap  (added as MW verb) <br/>020 klIva <-> klIv  (added as MW verb) <br/>021 kvela <-> kvel (added as MW verb) <br/>024 KakKa <-> KakK (added as MW verb) <br/>026 KUrda <-> KUrd (added as MW verb) <br/>027 gagGa <-> gagG (added as MW verb) <br/>030 galha <-> galh (added as MW verb) <br/>031 gudra <-> gundr (added as MW verb) <br/>032 gU <-> gU (added as MW verb) <br/>036 cIb <-> cIb  (added as MW verb) <br/>037 cIya <-> cIy  (added as MW verb) <br/>038 culla <-> cull  (added as MW verb) <br/>039 cella <-> cell  (added as MW verb) <br/>046 ju <-> ju (added as MW verb) <br/>049 jrI <-> jrI (added as MW verb) <br/>052 qiBa <-> qimB (added as MW verb) <br/>068 Rida <-> nid (nid added as MW verb) <br/>079 RU <-> nU (added as MW verb) <br/>087 truPa <-> truP (added as MW verb) <br/>088 trumpa <-> trump (added as MW verb) <br/>089 trumPa <-> trumP (added as MW verb) <br/>094 dfmpa <-> dfmp (added as MW verb) <br/>098 DmAkza <-> DmANkz  (added as MW verb) <br/>099 DrAkza <-> DrANkz  (added as MW verb) <br/>109 baWa <-> baW  (added as MW verb) <br/>111 baBra <-> baBr (added as MW verb) <br/>114 bF <-> bF (added as MW verb) <br/>119 Bila <-> Bil (added as MW verb) <br/>130 misra <-> misr (added as MW verb) <br/>133 mula <-> mul (added as MW verb) <br/>135 meba <-> meb (added as MW verb) <br/>138 mleqa <-> mleq (added as MW verb) <br/>143 rASa <-> rAS (added as MW verb) <br/>151 luja <-> luYj (added as MW verb) <br/>163 vADa <-> vAD (added as MW verb) <br/>164 vIBa <-> vIB (added as MW verb) <br/>165 vuDa <-> vuD (added as MW verb) <br/>166 vusa <-> vus  (added as MW verb) <br/>169 veTa <-> veT (added as MW verb, with viT - MW apparently forgot veT headword) <br/>171 vrIsa <-> vrIs (added as MW verb) <br/>172 vlekza <-> vlekz (added as MW verb) <br/>175 SAntva <-> SAntv (added as MW verb) <br/>176 SAra <-> SAr (added as MW verb) <br/>179 SOqa <-> SOq (added as MW verb) <br/>180 SvF <-> svF ? (added as MW verb) <br/>181 zaga <-> zag (added as MW verb) <br/>182 zaGa <-> zaG (added as MW verb) <br/>183 zaca <-> zac (added as MW verb) <br/>184 zaYca <-> saYc (added as MW verb) <br/>266 zvartta <-> svart (added as MW verb) <br/>272 sparSa <-> sparS (added as MW verb) <br/>275 svaWa <-> svaW (added as MW verb) <br/>278 svaska <-> svask (added as MW verb) <br/>279 svF <-> svF (added as MW verb) <br/>282 hrapa <-> hrap (added as MW verb) <br/></code>
<br/>Once these changes were made and mw.xml updated, then the MW root extraction file,
<br/><a href="https://github.com/funderburkjim/MWvlex/blob/master/step0/verb_step0a.txt">verb_step0a.txt</a> was
<br/>regenerated.  This file is used as the representative of MW roots in the Wilson-MW roots comparison
<br/>project. </p>

          <p>It's a fascinating work. To reevaluate what has been done months and years will be needed. But the amount of markup additions even in MW makes me think there are thousands of tags missing. That means there are not less than 100 000 tags missing in other dictionaries.
<br/>In my personal list of priorities:
<br/>1) headword corrections
<br/>2) basic grammar info
<br/>3) dhatu correspondences.
<br/>Batch correction of entries, string comparison of textual quotes, interlinking - that's a question of next 5-15 years.</p>
