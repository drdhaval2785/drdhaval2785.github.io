    "body": "Ever since this issue was raised in Oct 2014, I have made it an objective to convert the base form of each digitization\r\nfrom HK to SLP1.   By the `base form` of a digitization for dictionary X I mean X.txt.  (e.g., pwg.txt, md.txt, etc.)\r\nThis task has been done for 21 of 36 of the dictionaries (see below) \r\n\r\nLet me explaiin a little more, using PWG as an example.  \r\n* The original digitization of PWG exists as a text file named pwg_orig.txt.  This is the file as obtained from\r\n   Thomas.  It has at least two features which make it hard to work with:\r\n  * It uses an old encoding for 8-bit ascii characters, ~~call~~ called CP1252  (code-page 1252).  \r\n  * Devanagari is coded using the Harvard-Kyoto transliteration\r\n* pwg_orig_utf8.txt converts the cp1252 encoding of extended ascii to the current standard utf8 encoding.\r\n   This is a comparitively straightforward conversion, and there is an inverse conversion in order to validate\r\n    that no information loss occurs.\r\n* pwg_orig_utf8_slp1.txt   Here the coding of Devanagari is converted from HK to SLP1.   This is actually\r\n  what I call the 'base form' of the digitization.  All the corrections we make are 'installed' starting with\r\n  this version,\r\n* pwg.txt  is the current corrected form of the dictionary.  It is also in the utf8 encoding, and Devanagari\r\n  is coded as SLP1.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the slp1 base version (pwg_orig_utf8_slp1.txt) is surprisingly tricky.   The reason is\r\nthat there are various minor oddities in the HK coding.  One especially tricky part is the use of the period\r\npunctuation mark in coding of text which is Devanagari.   The period in 'standard' HK and SLP1 is used to\r\nrepresent the daRqa.  However, this period also commonly occurs in the bilingual dictionaries as English\r\n(or German, etc.) punctuation.  In some digitizations, Thomas has used a vertical bar in Devanagari to \r\nrepresent the daRqa, and a period to represent non-Sanskrit punctuation.  But usually there are \r\ninconsistencies in the use of the period in text marked as Devanagari, and this question has to be\r\naddressed.   It is a challenge and makes the construction of the slp1 form non-trivial, tedious and non-enjoyable.  That's my excuse for why some\r\nof the dictionaries with HK-coded Devanagari have not been converted to SLP1 yet.\r\n\r\nHere's a list where the Devanagari IS converted to SLP1 in the base form  and there is an\r\nx_orig_utf8_slp1.txt form of the dictionary:\r\n\r\n```\r\nACC,AP90,AP,BEN,BOR,BUR,CAE,CCS,GST,MCI,MD,MW72,PWG,PW,SCH,SHS,SKD,WIL,YAT\r\n```\r\nHere's the list where there is no x_orig_utf8_slp1.txt form:  \r\n```\r\nMW,,VCP  have slp1 coding. See below\r\nBHS,GRA,SNP,STC,VEI  have no Devanagari. All Sanskrit is in AS (Anglicized Sanskrit)\r\n\r\nThese 4 dictionaries have a small amount of HK coded Devanagari, and are a secondary TODO list.\r\nIEG,INM Devanagari only in preface, PE (26 instances) , PUI (3 instances)\r\n\r\nThese dictionaries have substantial HK coded Devanagari.  They form the main TODO list.\r\nAE,BOP,KRM,MWE,PD,PGN\r\n```\r\n\r\n* MW   Devanagari is already in SLP1 form.  There are files mw_orig.txt and mw_orig_utf8.txt.\r\n  mw_orig.txt is the form of MW1899 that Thomas provided way back in 2006 when Peter and I\r\n  first became involved in the Cologne Sanskrit-Lexicon project that Thomas began in the 1990s.\r\n  The current reference form for MW is mw.xml.  \r\n* VCP The base form has a different file name: vcp0.txt, which is utf8 and has text in SLP1.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, the x.xml files for all these dictionaries have Devanagari coded as SLP1.\r\n"

    "body": "Re Thomas use (within coding of Devanagari) of vertical bar for danda, and period for English punctuation.\r\n\r\nThis convention is true in many dictionaries, but not all, as I recall. \r\n\r\nWe shouldn't keep this in coding of Devanagari.  Since we have decided to use SLP1 as the coding system\r\nfor Devanagari, we should follow the SLP1 conventions.  In SLP1, the period represents danda.\r\n\r\nBut this then leave open the question of how to represent, in SLP1, a 'true' period?  The answer I've used\r\nis to take the true periods out of SLP1 -  the  true period is not Devanagari, so should not be included as\r\npart of a section of text identified as coding Devanagari.\r\n\r\nFor instance,  suppose we see in a dictionary the English sentence: `The word for dog is श्वन्.`\r\nThomas would typically code this as `The word for dog is {#zvan.#}`  (note period inside {##}).\r\nIf, in conversion to SLP1 this was coded as `The word for dog is {#Svan.#}`  and if this were then\r\nconverted back to Devanagari, we would see `The word for dog is श्वन्।`, which disagrees with the\r\noriginal sentence because the period of the original sentence has been treated as a danda.\r\nThe solution is to have the SLP1 conversion of the sentence to be `The word for dog is {#Svan#}.`  (i.e., to move the period outside of the scope of the {##} Devanagari delimiters.\r\n\r\nThis is the approach taken in converting from Thomas' HK coding (e.g. pwg_orig_utf8.txt) to an SLP1\r\ncoding (pwg_orig_utf8_slp1.txt).  This task is accomplished by a script called 'transcode.py' which is\r\nin the convertwork directory of the xml download for pwg.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "regarding `Once SLP1 for all dicts are available we would have more candidates for\r\ncomparision of faultfinder`:\r\n\r\nActually, the headwords for all the dictionaries have ALWAYS been in SLP1 form (except for the three\r\nEnglish-Sanskrit dictionaries, of course).  Recall that, if X is one of these dictionaries, then Xhw2.txt \r\nconsists of the headwords *in SLP1*.  This was true even before this conversion work.  The conversion\r\nwork dealt with the Devanagari text in X.txt, as Devanagari in X.txt was, before SLP1 conversion, still represented in the  HK form that Thomas' original digitizations provided.  \r\n\r\nAdmittedly this was confusing.  At least this one confusion is now removed in the digitizations.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I definitely agree with the sentiment that *we should finish the headword checking process via\r\nfaultfinder* for those dictionaries whose headword-differences generated by faultfinder have not yet been\r\nexamined.  These dictionaries are listed in the 'faultfinder TODO(1)' section of [issue 90](https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/90).   The dictionary in this list with the largest set of faultfinder candidates is PD.  Finishing this task that Dhaval began will be an important milestone in our correction process.\r\n\r\n"
