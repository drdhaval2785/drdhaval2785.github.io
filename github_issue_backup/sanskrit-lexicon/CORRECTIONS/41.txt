But as I wanted to build a graph of change made in 2014 I realized that someones uses at least three different formats:\r\n* status =  Corrected Apr 18\r\n* status =  Corrected 11/23/2014\r\n* status =  Corrected Nov 19, 2014\r\n\r\nNone of them is understandable outside US. Because `11/23/2014` over the pond would be written as `23/11/2014`. But any single standard is better than three at once, do you agree, @funderburkjim ? Thanks.",

Timestamp:   When an entry to this sheet is via the Correction Form,  this field is filled in by some automatic process.  e.g. 3/18/2014 14:48:54 .  I don't know what governs this format, maybe the fact that the owner (me) of the sheet is in US is why it shows MM/DD/YYYY.  Changing this format is thus likely hard to enforce.\r\n\r\nb. Your Email Address.  The format of this field IS controllable, and it is the field you have mentioned in your example of inconsistent formats.   I have made this field have the defacto format of \r\n```\r\nuser:comment\r\n```\r\n<b>user</b>  is what the user fills in for 'Your Email' on the Correction Form.\r\nand I add <b>:comment</b> when the correction is made.   Generally this comment is of the form 'Corrected DATE'.  \r\n\r\n1. Please confirm that the date in 'Corrected DATE'  is the date about whose format you are suggesting a change\r\n2. And, In light of the autogenerated MM/DD/YYYY in the Timestamp column,  do you nonetheless still affirm your preference for DD/MM/YYYY in the 'Your Email Address' field?\r\n\r\n"
