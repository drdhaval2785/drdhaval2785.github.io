In this instance, we agree with the suggestion .  So , in your local copy of pui-fuzzyalpha.txt\r\nyou would change that line with the arrow from\r\n\r\n```\r\n001 akzayawrtIyA ->  (akzayatftIyA)\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```\r\n001 akzayawrtIyA -> akzayatftIyA :  (akzayatftIyA)\r\n```\r\nI.e., the corrected spelling goes to the right of the arrow AND  a 'Colon' follows the correction, to separate it\r\n  from suggestions.\r\n\r\nThat's it.\r\n\r\nSince Dhaval is working on PUI,  you don't need to.  But the same principles apply to PGN in issue 103,\r\nwhich I hope you will try.\r\n\r\nHope this helps some.\r\n"

    "body": "Regarding 'aSvins'  \r\n\r\nI think this distinction can be captured by have a difference between key1 and key2.  key1 should be\r\naSvin.  key2 should be left intact (aSvins).   Programmatically, hw1.py would probably be the function that\r\nshould make the distinction.\r\n\r\nThus we are not 'correcting' pui.txt  but rather we are enhancing the 'key1' metadata, which ultimately appears in puihw2.txt and fills the role of 'key1' in pui.xml. (and is used as the 'citation' form in headword\r\nlookups for PUI).\r\n\r\nIt might be that in the corrections file you are dealing with, you should leave this as NO CHANGE.\r\nAnd that a separate list of 'plurals' should be developed for PUI (pui_plurals.txt)  and this list would be\r\nadded as an input to hw1.py for pui.\r\n\r\nHow does this approach sound to you?\r\n"

    "body": "@drdhaval2785  The bulk of the corrections have now been made.  There were a few where I had questions.\r\n\r\nFirst group,  'L' (SLP1).\r\n* cUxikas -> cULikas    (AS coding is Cu1l2ikas)\r\n  * I think this is plural (plurality will be dealt with separately in another issue, as mentioned above)\r\n  * MW has 'cUlika'\r\n* vinDyamOxIyas -> vinDyamOLIyas  (AS coding is Vindhyamaul2i1yas)\r\n  * Also a plural\r\n  * MW has vinDyamOleya\r\n\r\nThe letter in question: IAST  l with under-dot == AS l2  ==? SLP1 L.\r\n\r\nMW shows both these examples with the semivowel 'l'.\r\n\r\nThe L occurs in MW in word 'iLas' = इळस्  and in Roman (IAST) display = iḷas\r\n\r\nBut also, SLP1 kxp displays as 'kḷp' in MW = कॢप् and the 'x' represents vowel\r\n\r\nIn [IAST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Alphabet_of_Sanskrit_Transliteration)  there is no\r\nmention of ḷ  (l with dot below).\r\n\r\nAlso, ळ is not part of the Sanskrit alphabet as I learned it, although  it appears in this [alphabet](http://www.omniglot.com/writing/sanskrit.htm).\r\n\r\nSo, there are several confusions about ळ  that I need to get straight before entering these changes.\r\n* How does one pronounce ळ ?\r\n* Is ळ really part of Sanskrit alphabet?  If so, why is it absent from so many listings of the alphabet.\r\n* If so is the above omniglot display correct in its placement in alphabet?\r\n* Is there a 'standard' IAST representation?  If so, does the standard IAST representation of SLP1 'x' differ?"

    "body": "1. `How does one pronounce ळ ?`\r\nAs ḷ is instead of ḍ, same is the pronunciation (and ḷh instead of ḍh). Pali grammarians (p. 40, Pali Language 1965) note that pronunciation of ऌ gets mixed with ल sometimes. In IAST a mix happens.\r\n\r\n2. `Is ळ really part of Sanskrit alphabet? If so, why is it absent from so many listings of the alphabet.`\r\nThere is no such thing as Sanskrit alphabet, it's a fiction. For the need of Vedic texts and Marathi ळ is used. Sanskrit is a language. Devanagari is a writing syllabary. It's one of the alphabets widely used nowadays, similar to Bengali characters used just 200 years ago.\r\n\r\n3. `If so is the above omniglot display correct in its placement in alphabet?`\r\nYes and no. Omniglot's creator thinks I'm an authority (see http://www.omniglot.com/blog/?p=682 and http://www.omniglot.com/blog/?p=621) and I as an authority can say that it is positioned there only because there was some free place, no scientific background. It should be in a footnote.\r\n\r\n4. `Is there a 'standard' IAST representation? If so, does the standard IAST representation of SLP1 'x' differ?`\r\nSee p. 12 of http://shashir.autodidactus.org/shashir_umich/dl/rapportdetranscription.pdf - IAST always had only ḷ, but the mixing was always there (see a whole paragraph on it). I hardly understand how it can differ from SLP1 even theoretically, because SLP1 is a pure abstraction that has nothing to do with phonetics, diacritics of tradition."
