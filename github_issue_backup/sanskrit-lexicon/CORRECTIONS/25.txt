We check the base dictionary for different Vowel and consonant patterns like VV, VCV, VCCV, VCCCV etc. (We presume that the base dictionary has correct entries - which need not be true).\r\n2. We check the dictionary to be tested for different vowel and consonant patterns like 1 above.\r\n3. If the pattern is not found in 1, but found in 2 - we note that in suspectfalse.html.\r\n4. We check those entries from dictionary scans and verify.\r\n5. If wrong word is detected, it is intimated to the webmaster here.\r\n\r\n",
