The main difference is that with n-grams you are looking at sequences of characters in a character string while with shingles you are looking at sequences of 'tokens'  (e.g. of words).\r\n\r\n@gasyoun   Your 'fuzzy' approach is still 'fuzzy' to me, although I understand the basic 'edit distance' idea of string comparison.  The approach might be more widely usable if, like the faultfinder tactic, it were developed into a program.  Perhaps you and Dhaval are already developing such a program?\r\n\r\n"
