    "body": "Sounds like a good idea.  \r\n\r\nI think it's best to do this on sandev, since we all have access there.\r\n\r\nI copied the SCH/2014 directory there just now.\r\n\r\nStart by reading the top-level 'readme.org' file in the SCH directory - just skim read it.  \r\nThen look at pywork/update.sh, redo_hw.sh, and redo_xml.sh.\r\n\r\nThere are a few differences between the operating environment on sandev and that on the Cologne server, but these differences seem minor.\r\n\r\nOne difference is the 'default' python version.   At Cologne, the default version (python --version) is\r\n5.4.  However, Cologne also has a 2.6 version, accessible via 'python26'.  On sandev,  the default version is 2.6, but the 'python26' command is unknown.   There are several ways to deal with this on sandev.  One way is shown in 'update.sh' , where I put the line\r\n```\r\nalias python26='python'\r\n```\r\nat the top.\r\nAnother way would have been just to change all 'python26' to 'python' in that file.\r\nsandev is a Linux system.  I haven't made this change in other scripts (notably, redo_hw.sh will need this change.) \r\n\r\nInstead of Windows batch files (x.bat), you can use shell scripts 'x.sh' and run them via\r\n'sh x.sh'.  \r\n\r\nI also had to (in the SCH directory)\r\n```\r\nchmod -R 0755 web\r\n```\r\nso that the web displays have permission to be displayed.\r\n\r\nThe 'redo.sh' script in web/sqlite required a minor change, and I had to install a version of 'sqlite3'.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo deal with making 'SAl' the key1 headword instead of 'SAl(ate)', normally (i.e. for most dictionaries) hw1.py would be the program that needs modification.  However, SCH is different.  And probably a more radical approach will be required, starting with headword.py and hw0.py.  It will take some experimenting to get the right approach.\r\n\r\nThe 'dev' documentation might be good to review (using Cologne site).\r\n\r\nI think you will find Python easy to get used to.  One important starting detail is that in Python scripts\r\n(like hw1.py), the indentation is significant.  Also, there are no ending semicolons, and no curly brackets.  I'll explain the other details of Python as questions arise.\r\n\r\n"

I can see 'move' which gets converted to the following in Updatelinelog.txt\r\n```\r\n11 Change(move,13388,13386)\r\nline 13388 : .{#cuRwCedane#}100{#cun2t2(chedane)#}¦ S I , 245 , 8 (Ko.; {%cun2t2ita)%}; II , 198 , 5 v.u.
