    "body": "For our information, here is my email question to Peter regarding M~, and his response:\r\n```\r\nPeter -\r\n In PWG, there are 577 records of pwg.xml in which the current coding of Devanagari in SLP1 includes \r\na ~.  In almost all of these, the form is VOWEL+M+~.   Is the form M~ redundant in SLP1, i.e., should \r\nall of these cases be changed to VOWEL+~ ?\r\n Incidentally, why is candra-bindu used at all - does it represent a different pronunciation than M? \r\nWhy is it absent from the usual listing of the Devanagari alphabet?\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\nDear Jim,\r\n\"M~\" is not meaningful in SLP1.  'M' indicates anusvAra; '~' indicates nasalization which does not apply to \r\nanusvAra since anusvAra is already a nasal sound.\r\nI believe the endoding \"M~\" is a relic of Thomas' original encoding which distinguished bindu from candra \r\nbindu.  In SKD at least, bindu was encoded as M and candrabindu as MM.  We should check whether \"M~\" \r\nrepresents candrabindu as MM did in SKD.\r\nNow the use of bindu and candrabindu in Devanagari Vedic texts varies so it is not clear what the phonetic \r\nsignificance is without some further investigation.  When it occurs above a vowel or semivowel y, l, or v, \r\ncandra bindu represents nasalization of the vowel or semivowel.  If candrabindu occurs with a virama (or \r\navagraha) below it, it indicates an anusvAra.  Many texts use bindu for an anusvAra that is susceptible to \r\nbeing replaced by a stop homorganic with the following stop, e.g. vanaM gacCati could become by sandhi \r\nvanaN gacCati, but contrast this with a 'true' anusvAra, which only occurs before spirants (S, z, s, h) and r, \r\ne.g. vanaM sarati, vanaM rocate.  If the use of M~ is consistent according to the above contexts, it may be \r\npossible to accurately transcode the 'M~' to either 'M' or '~' depending upon that context.\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n"
