If, for some purpose, you wanted to have just the 'body' elements,\r\nyou could write a PHP program to read your output files, interpret the JSON, and write out just the body\r\nelements to some file.\r\n\r\nAre you going to commit to periodically backing up the issues for all the sanskrit-lexicon repositories?\r\n\r\nIf so, we  could all clone that repository when you do an update,  so there will be distributed copies in case\r\nGasyoun's GitHub disaster scenario should come to pass.\r\n\r\nA possible enhancement would be to download the images (dictionary excerpts) that appear with many of\r\nthe comments.   I'm not sure this would be worth the trouble, but wanted to mention.\r\n\r\n"
