  "body": "This issue looks for headword spelling errors drawn from a list of 289 alphabetical misorderings in the Wilson dictionary.  In contrast to the prior list of 417 misorderings, most of these probably will not need correction.  These are cases where both the misordered headwords appear in other dictionaries besides Wilson; there are 776 of these  [less likely spelling errors](https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/WIL/blob/master/alphawork/chksort1a_rest.txt) .  \r\n\r\nThe present list of 289 is drawn from the larger list as follows.\r\n\r\nEach of the 776 misorderings involves a pair of consecutive headwords from the dictionary ordered list of Wilson headwords, and it is true that the first of this pair of headwords does not alphabetically precede the second.  Consider either one of these, and call it X.\r\n\r\nNext, consider all the headwords Y appearing in ANY dictionary  (i.e., Y is in the sanhw1.txt list),\r\nand choose only those Y such that three conditions hold:\r\nY and X start with the same letter\r\nY and X are nearly the same (specifically, the Levenshtein (or edit) distance between X and Y is 1 or 2.\r\nIf Y is used in place of X, then the alphabetical ordering will be restored at this position in the headword list.\r\n\r\nThe set of those X for which there is one or more such Y is the list of 289 headwords being considered here.  Note that furthermore, Y provides us with one or more suggestions as to the\r\ncorrection to make.  Of course, sometimes the suggestion Y will be wrong.  And, since X occurs\r\nin more dictionaries than just Wilson,  Y will usually be wrong.  \r\n\r\nNonethesless, we will get some errors, and reducing from 776 to 289 is a 2/3 reduction in cases to\r\nexamine.\r\n\r\nIn the following, I will show details only for those cases where a spelling correction is found to be required.",

(I can still revise if Dhaval finds some that need revision.)\r\n\r\nA file [chksort2.txt](https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/dictionaries/WIL/chksort2.txt) has the remaining cases (766) of alphabetical misorderings in Wilson.  75 of these contain a 'NOTE ' indicating the likely reason for the misordering.  There are probably a few spelling errors in this list, if anyone wants to check -  currently I've had my fill of Wilson for a while.  But the headword list is probably a lot cleaner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
