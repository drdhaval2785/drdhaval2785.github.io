To get even more dirty laundry - could you unreveal the secret sources from which you take out those pythons and .txt files? There seems to be an endless ocean of them. Somewhere on your HDD. I just wonder if they'll be gone one day. If backed up here somewhere around, we could have at least a chance. Now we can only pray you do get there one day."

It's useless? 2 or 3 dashes - just a random generation?\"\r\n\r\nAt one time I thought the right principle  was to have have one dash separating H1&H2 base from H3 portion, and two dashes separating H3 base from H4 portion.   However, this informal rule has been applied so irregularly, and there are so many divergences from even this rule (as your '-----' shows), that the current Number of dashes is not useful.  \r\n\r\nHowever, as mentioned in https://github.com/funderburkjim/MWlexnorm/blob/master/step1a/readme.txt , I do think the dashes in key2 have use, just not the number of dashes.   I hope the (not yet finished) work on rationalizing key2 in MW can be redone under MWlexnorm.  In this process, a more useful key2 form may emerge.   This more useful form will take into account not only the hyphens, but also the 'sr' and 'srs' markup present in key2.   When brought to the state I anticipate, key2 will provide both useful intra-headword relationships, and also  part of the information needed to accurately generate declensions and feminine forms for substantives.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Currently, there has been so much good activity with corrections, that I haven't had a chance to continue this revision.  When I do revisit this, my intention is to robustly document each step as it proceeds, so that others may be able to make constructive suggestions.  \r\n"

    "body": "We are not in a hurry. What I really worry about is the pureness of headwords, because at it seems in a few months from now my Reverse dictionary might actually get printed and every word counts. Lexical data would make it a Grammar dictionary instead of just reverse, but as there is only a single Jim around, hardly possible till early 2015, I guess.\r\n\r\n```\r\n#sveda#\r\n#svéda#\r\n#a-sveda#\r\n#saṁ-sveda#\r\n#antáḥ--sveda#\r\n#píṇḍa--sveda#\r\n#guptá--sveda#\r\n#upa-sveda#\r\n#tāpa--sveda#\r\n#sopasveda#\r\n#púṣpa--sveda#\r\n#gharmá--sveda#\r\n#uṣma--sveda#\r\n#saṁ-kara---sveda#\r\n#pra-stará---sveda#\r\n#pra-sveda#\r\n#pāda--prasveda#\r\n#sa--prasveda#\r\n#dravá--sveda\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhy `#pāda--prasveda#` and `#sopasveda#` unsplit when there is no sandhi? @drdhaval2785 can you think of any automation for such to-be split cases? If `sveda` is already a known legal ending for compositas, can it be marked in such cases where there is no sandhi? Or even when there is a sandhi, to mark it as in MW?"
