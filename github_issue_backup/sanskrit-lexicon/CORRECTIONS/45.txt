    "body": "Currently developing a comparision text based on sanhw1.txt.\r\nNot cleaned one.\r\nThe same old unclean one.\r\n\r\nLogic for filtering the words are as below:\r\n1. The case insensitive comparision should be 100% (strcasecmp($a1,$a2)===0\r\n2. both words should not be identical ($a1!==$a2)\r\n3. None of the dictionary should be Pune Dictionary ($dict1!==\"PD\" and $dict2!==\"PD\"). The reason behind removing this dictionary is that it has a long list of words starting with 'a'. Gives a lot of false positives.\r\n4. The words are not from the same dictionary ($a1,$a2 don't belong to the same dictionary)\r\n5. The last words are not a,A,m,M and the difference is not in the last letter only. (to accommodate for musculine/feminine and m/M ending issues).\r\n\r\nWe are taking a bunch of 10000 words from sanhw1 and comparing each against 9999.\r\nThe reason behind taking 10000 bunch is to minimize the time, because comparing 1 word against 400000 odd words would be too computationally heavy.\r\nTherefore, 10000 seem fine for comparision.\r\nAs the words confused by the 'o'/'O' etc in the middle would have the same starting pattern, there are very less chances of missing some important catch by taking 10000 batch.\r\n"

The question is how to help her help us. If `धव्हल->धवल` format is ok for Jim before he plans to do the needed adjustments (which might come in Autumn 2015), we could start testing not loosing time in parallel.\r\nईLइत conversion issues are still around, Dhaval is aware of them.\r\nSLP1 part in the reference file http://drdhaval2785.github.io/o_vs_O/output1/MW.html is mostly needed for Jim. But it helps me as well - as the capital letters stand out and as there is no bold formatting used to mark the difference, there is some practical use of SLP1 in the reference file, but indeed it is not needed for .txt, where the corrections are made. I hope Jim can take the devanagari files, convert them back again to SLP1 and everybody will work productively.\r\nThe dancing :dancer: width of columns make me mad. Even if we make the width of content vs abbreviations 50% each, they will dance, if all the page is not a single table. @drdhaval2785 Maybe make it and add the headers as text inside table cells?\r\nLinks in 2nd column are broken `http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/PWG%3Cbr%3EScan/?/web/webtc/indexcaller.php?key=BagavadBaskara&input=slp1&output=SktDevaUnicode` for example `भगवद्विलासरत्नावली` case.\r\nAfter reading `If you see any errors in the dictionary other than the one you are dealing with, leave it.` I was thinking that at the header and footer of each of the `o_vs_O/output1/` files we should add interlinking to all the other 33 dictionary o_vs_O files. So I would not have to browse them or download locally just to switch, because already I see that starting with one takes me to issues in another which I would not want to delay or forget. Like BEN | BUR | CAE | CCS | MD | MW | MW72 | PW | PWG | SHS | SKD | STC | WIL | YAT.\r\nAbout sorting - http://tablesorter.com/docs/ and http://www.listjs.com/ seem to be what I miss, 2nd one has even search, that's great, because I often use search for some specific letters."
