  "body": "This issue shows corrections drawn from case=02 of the compare2.txt file.  This file was generated by\r\ncomparing the current wilhw2.txt list of headwords from the Wilson dictionary with the headwords from a 2011 research version of Wilson ('wiltab'). This research version was developed by Peter Scharf and Matthias Ahlborn with programming assistance from me. In a later comment in this issue I will link to various end results from this version, and to the current work which led to the compare2.txt file.\r\n\r\nThe case=02 collection has 87 cases where corrections to the current wilhw2 may be needed.\r\n",

    "body": "Re 28 -  I still think this headword is intended to end in 'za', not just 'z'.   Note that the\r\nparenthetical nominative singular of this neuter noun is shown as 'zaM'.  If the headword were\r\naDijyotiz, then this would show differently , perhaps (tiw)  (like for headword 'viz').  \r\n\r\nA second reason is that WIL has head word 'jyotiza', as an adjective. This is derived in some way from  theheadword 'jyotis'.\r\n\r\nA third reason is the MW has jyotiza, aDijyotiza, and jyotis, and does not have jyotiz.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "Re: The list compare2 needs to get links to those words in dict.\r\n\r\nTo examine the case 2 corrections as above, I first got a list with links as follows:\r\n```\r\n1. Edit compare2.txt with a text editor, select the 'case 2' records, and \r\n    save in file compare2-case02.txt\r\n2. Write an adaptor program, convert.py, and apply it via:\r\n  python convert.py compare2-case02.txt case02_ff.txt case02.txt\r\n\r\n Lines of case02_ff.txt are like\r\nakakkaSa:VCV=XXX:WIL\r\n\r\nso case02_ff.txt is a file that faultfinder3a-html.php can use as input.\r\n3. Apply faultfinder3a-html.php :\r\nphp faultfinder3a-html.php case02_ff.txt case02_ff.html\r\n\r\nNow case02_ff.html is a browser file with links that can be used to investigate the words.\r\n\r\n4. Incidentally, the other file (case02.txt) created in step 2 has records like \r\n001 akakkaSa -> akarkkaSa :  CORRECTION(A), MW=akarkaSa\r\nand saves some typing when generating the issue comments.\r\n\r\n```\r\n(faultfinder3a-html.php program is from [sanskritspellcheck](https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritSpellCheck/). )\r\nThis procedure is admittedly kludgy,  but is functionally useful and was quick to implement.\r\n\r\nIt probably should be applicable for examining other cases in compare2.txt.\r\n\r\nSince the question was raised, I've put  convert.py and other generated files into subfolder\r\n[wiltabwork/linkwork](https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/WIL/tree/master/wiltabwork/linkwork) ."
