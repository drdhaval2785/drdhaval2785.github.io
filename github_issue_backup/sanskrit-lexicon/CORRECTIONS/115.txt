  "body": "In working with ACC,  I happened to notice kowISvaramAhAtmya in PW.  According to the scan of PW, this\r\nshould be spelled kow**e**SvaramAhAtmya , as it is in ACC.\r\nHowever, when making the change to PW just now, I noticed that the change from 'I' to 'e' would put the\r\nword out of alphabetical order in PW.  Also, I realized I could not explain the compound 'koweSvara' , although\r\nthe explanation of 'kowISvara' as 'kowi + ISvara' is easy.\r\n\r\nSo, now I'm wondering if the printed form kow**e**SvaramAhAtmya  in PW is itself wrong.\r\n\r\nHere's the scan of PW:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6393033/7668445/acacf922-fc07-11e4-8f6c-4c234cecd061.png)\r\n\r\nCan any of our Sanskrit experts clarify the situation?\r\n",
