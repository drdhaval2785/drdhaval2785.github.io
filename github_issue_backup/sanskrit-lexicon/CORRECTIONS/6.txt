The Author is Buhler, so it should be same edition.\r\n\r\nThere is a section 11 (page 159 of pdf), and here is verse 49:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6393033/5152034/cfaefb46-71b5-11e4-8d25-a73e0b9062c4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSo, Marcis correction yAminIpriyatama  IS right; this is a printing or factual error in PW.\r\nAnd I'm making that change now to PW digitization.\r\n\r\n"
