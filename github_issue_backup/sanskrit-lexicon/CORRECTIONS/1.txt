The material Dhaval has prepared above would be part of the site. Since @gasyoun has good instincts regarding web page design, he should take the lead in maintaining this site.  Once the site design is established, we can decide on exactly which page of the site the Corrections-Help link from Cologne should land on.\r\n\r\nRegarding number of links per Cologne Page,  I think we should stick to just 1 link (to the Github sanskrit-lexicon site).

The site might also have other uses.\r\n\r\n  [Github Pages] (https://pages.github.com/) explains how to start.  In this case, I think a 'project site' is what is wanted.
