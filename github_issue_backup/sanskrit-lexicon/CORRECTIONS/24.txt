This pair is so odd (not being words at all, but just suffixes), that it begs for some markup that indicates the nature of the oddity.  There are other headwords we've come across in recent memory (such as AIkz in MW) which are also odd in some way.  For many purposes (e.g., MWlexnorm) such odd records should be ignored.   And this is not just an issue with MW.\r\n\r\nSo, maybe a constructive thing to do would be to come up with some ideas regarding markup for our pals -tta, -tti and their shady friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Occam's razor does not allows and makes no sense in introducing new elements where there is no need for them.\r\nUPD. Peter wrote:\r\n`Since tta and tti are respectively dA + ta and dA + ti, they are equally derivates of the root dA.  If MW were consistent, he should have made both level 2 headwords in Roman and listed these under the root dA.  But because they don't begin with 'd' so are far from their parent, he listed them separately  in alphabetic order instead of as derivates of dA and put them as shown with the first as a main headword and the second as a related word.`\r\nAnd `Well, it IS consistent as Jim pointed out, because the tta entry is in Devanagari.  Roman headwords are always subordinate to a preceding Devanagari headword.  If we make tta Roman, they will be improperly subordinated to the preceding Devanagari word.  On the other hand, now that this is a digital dictionary, alphabetic order has little relevance and we could just subordinate these words in our hierarchical list to dA1 'give', and tta also to dA3 'cut'.\r\nI would let Jim and Thomas decide which way to go.`"
