    "body": "Here's my two cents worth.\r\n\r\n1. The parentheses appear in what I call  the 'key2' form of the headword.  In all the dictionaries but MW, the program hw0.py is responsible for identifying (in the digitization X.txt) the key2 form of the headword. Then, the program hw1.py is responsible for analyzing key2 and deducing 'key1'. Thus, it is hw1.py which is currently throwing away parenthetical alternates.  And it seems plausible that making use of these alternates would be the responsibility of an enhanced hw1.\r\nAs Marcis has discovered, interpreting alternate spellings can be tricky - that's mainly why I punted in the current hw1 and did not attempt the task.  Another reason is that I am not clear regarding the appropriate data structures to represent alternate spellings; the solution that was used in MW was less than ideal, but it may be easier in the other dictionaries.\r\n\r\n2. In terms of priorities, it seems premature to tackle the task of alternate headword spellings until we are fairly sure that typographical errors in headwords are few. "
