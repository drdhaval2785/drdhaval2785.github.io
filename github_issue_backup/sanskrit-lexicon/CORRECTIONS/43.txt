They usually enter the base only. e.g. He will enter aMSuka in most probability and never aMSukam. We will have to see what words in dictionaries of options 3 are neuter gender. We can safely code their uninflected counterparts to land on inflected counterparts. e.g. If a user enters aMSuka in SKD, he should land on saMSukam page.\r\n\r\n**Coding implications of options 5 and 6** -\r\nThis is difficult choice to make, but I will go for option 6 as default (Because it is virtually impossible to determine mechanically the difference in options 1/2 and 5/6 i.e. whether the M is the end of first word of compound or not. So we will have to stick to 6 which is counterpart of 2).\r\nSet dictionaries having convention 5 to land on them with even fifth letter as input. e.g. If a person enters saNgIta in MW - he should land on saMgIta data page in MW.\r\n\r\nHope I am clear in what I want in this section.\r\nIf some dictionaries are missing out, flag it up. We will try to locate the conventions in them."
