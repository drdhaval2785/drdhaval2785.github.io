    "body": "re: In SCH 4 is not good, do you agree. Can we make it /?  \r\n \r\n4 is commonly used as 'acute accent after previous letter' when the digitizations use AS (Anglicized Sanskrit) to code IAST.   The thing about the AS coding is that the language of the word being coded is not specified:  It could be Sanskrit (then we would say that the scan has IAST and the digitization is coding it using the AS encoding).  But it could, apriori, be French or Slavic, or who knows what.  \r\n\r\nThus, I think we should not now change the 4 to / in Schmidt. \r\n\r\nIf at some future time we identify that all the AS coding in Schmidt is indeed coding Sanskrit words that appear as IAST in the scan,  then we could safely recode the AS in some way more amenable to Sanskrit.\r\n"
