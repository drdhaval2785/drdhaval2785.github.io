All the dictionaries have many unresolved headword issues mentioned in their Xhw1_note.txt file.\r\n\r\nWhy are those periods there in the first place?  In the original HK version, these periods were vertical bars.\r\nNormally, in the HK version, vertical bars were used for daRqa.  However, I think they are used in these three cases for another purpose, to  indicate 'wide spacing' in the text.  In the conversion to SLP1, vertical bars\r\nwere changed to periods (SLP1 code for daRqa).  \r\n\r\nIncidentally, that ':AP90,VCP' line in sanhw1.txt is some kind of program error (in sanhw1.py) , or else\r\nsome bad data in ap90hw2.txt and vcphw2.txt.  \r\n"

There is no change to pd.txt (the periods are still there - look at a display for PD for anyasUkta and you'll see them).\r\n\r\n'wide spacing' means (in the scan 'A B C' instead of 'ABC').  In the anyasUkta example, there is space in the devanagari, in contrast to no space in nearby headwords.  I don't think this has any significance in these cases, but sometimes the Thomas' Sanskrit typists use this vertical bar around a phrase which they deem to have been printed with wide spacing.  Thus, I don't think the periods in the typing are necessarily errors in this case.  The display of daRqa's in this case is misleading, and could be corrected, but the correction is tedious and of small value, in my judgment.\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6393033/7191481/f4eb6f8e-e45b-11e4-95c2-f4acf5e00f0f.png)\r\n\r\n"
