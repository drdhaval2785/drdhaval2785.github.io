There is not even a combination of `mfx` there.

These correspondences between spellings would help to provide a multidictionary list of words. This might be an interesting project when the  pace of corrections slows.\r\n\r\nMatthias Ahlborn, Peter Scharf and I  (mostly Matthias) developed some rules (ca. 2012) for headword correspondence between PWG and MW  (and, to a lesser extent) between WIL and MW. I don't think this work has been published.\r\n"
