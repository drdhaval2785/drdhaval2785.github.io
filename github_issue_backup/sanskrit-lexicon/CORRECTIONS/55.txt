  "body": "A user submitted a correction under 'id' for Grassman.  It appears (at bottom of a long entry) in displays as:\r\n```\r\nnéd = ná£íd siehe für sich.\r\n```\r\nThis is at bottom of page 206 of scans:\r\n![image](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6393033/5497605/53e26700-86e1-11e4-9feb-457c832bab19.png)\r\n\r\nThe user's suggestion was\r\n```\r\nbest would be „ná‿íd“, possible is also „ná_íd“\r\n```\r\nSince I couldn't find the unicode representation for the first option, I chose to use the 2nd option, which is a simple ascii underscore character.\r\n\r\nIt happens that £ occurs many times (1000+) in the gra.txt digitization.  A small sample suggests that it always occurs as a separator between vowels in hiatus.  Since the underscore character does NOT occur in gra.txt, it is safe to replace £ with _.  At least in Emacs, that curved underscore does not show up well, (also, I don't know what Unicode character it is), so it seems best to use the underscore.\r\n\r\nComments?\r\n",

That is what I call uniformity and we are 1/20 there. `203F` is totally unicode http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/203f/index.htm - I would go for it, so as the user proposed."
