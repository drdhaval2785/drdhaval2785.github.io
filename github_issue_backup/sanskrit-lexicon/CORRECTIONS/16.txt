  "body": "Jim's question:\r\nI don't have an answer as of now. So need to explore further.\r\nTherefore flagged as a separate issue.\r\n\r\nre: pfTivizad, pfTivizWa and pfTivizWA three headwords should be there.\r\n\r\nAdded pfTivizWA , so all three now there.\r\n\r\nThere remains a question in my mind regarding pfTivizWA.\r\nIt is stated to be mfn. The question is 'How to decline?'\r\n\r\nWith the advanced search, there are at least 21 other words ending in zWA and stated to be mfn.\r\n```\r\naNgezWA  mfn. AV.\r\natizWA   mf   \r\naDvarezWA mfn RV\r\nanuzWA  mfn RV\r\nftuzWA  mfn VS\r\nganDarvezWA mfn MaitrS\r\ngartezWA  mfn  MaitrS\r\ngirizWA  mfn\r\nGarmyezWA mfn\r\npaTezWA mfn RV\r\npaTizWA mfn AV\r\nparizWA mfn RV, AV\r\nparvatezWA mfn RV\r\nbarhiHzWA  mfn RV\r\nBuvanezWA  mfn AV\r\nmaMhanezWA mfn RV\r\nmaDyamezWA mfn AV\r\nraThezWA  mfn RV, VS\r\nrayizWA  mfn AV\r\nbanDurezWA mfn RV\r\nharmyezWA  mfn  RV\r\n```\r\nAnd there are some other headwords ending in A marked as mfn in MW, e.g., dvijA.\r\n\r\nIn Kale, p. 35 (http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/KALEScan/disp1/index1.php?sfx=png), gopA is given as an exemplar for 'nouns ending in A, mas. and fem.).\r\nDo the above adjectives follow this pattern in mas. and fem?\r\n\r\nWhat is the declension for the adjectives in neuter? ( I did not find this case covered in Kale.)\r\nA conjecture is: In the neuter, change the long 'A' to short 'a', and decline like vana;\r\ne.g. nom. pfTivizWam, pfTivizWe, pfTivizWAni etc.\r\n",
