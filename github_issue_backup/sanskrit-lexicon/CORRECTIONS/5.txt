  "body": "Marcis submitted a correction re skanDas (slp1) in CCS. The display of the last line is\r\n§§§§§§MISSING.  An examination of the scan  versus the digitization (or, using the list display),\r\nshows that there actually are many headwords missing in the digitization between skanDas and stambin.\r\n\r\nFrom the scan, I typed the headwords in the form needed for the digitization:\r\n```\r\n.{#skandhAvAra#}¦\r\n.{#skandhin#}¦\r\n.{#skaªndhya#}¦\r\n.{#skambh#}¦\r\n.{#skaªmbha#}¦\r\n.{#sku#}¦\r\n.{#skhal#}¦\r\n.{#skhala#}¦\r\n.{#skhalana#}¦\r\n.{#stan#}¦\r\n.{#staªna#}¦\r\n.{#stanataTa#}¦\r\n.{#stanaªtha#}¦\r\n.{#stanaMdhaya#}¦\r\n.{#stanapAna#}¦\r\n.{#stanapAyin#}¦\r\n.{#stanamadhya#}¦\r\n.{#stanayitnuª#}¦\r\n.{#stanAntara#}¦\r\n.{#stanita#}¦\r\n.{#stanya#}¦\r\n.{#stabaka#}¦\r\n.{#stabdha#}¦\r\n.{#stabdhI#}¦\r\n.{#stabdhIbhAva#}¦\r\n.{#stamba#}¦\r\n.{#stambamitra#}¦\r\n```\r\nIf Marcis or someone will complete the above by filling  the missing defintions  I'll enter them into the\r\ndigitization.  Here are the rules of the CCS digitization:\r\n\r\n1.  Devanagari is coded as {#X#}, where X is in HK transliteration\r\nHere is info (from ccs-meta.txt) on special characters that may be needed.\r\nIf there are any others that you encounter, \r\nsee the Developer Documentation for CCS at Cologne website, or\r\ndownload ccs-meta.txt in the ccsxml download.\r\n```\r\nª  (\\u00aa) 11822 := FEMININE ORDINAL INDICATOR\r\n    ª = udatta,  ªª = svarita\r\n°  (\\u00b0)  6673 := DEGREE SIGN\r\n```\r\n2. Italicized text is included in curly braces {%%}\r\n\r\n3. The rest of the CCS digitization does NOT observe line breaks of the scan.\r\n     So, you don't need to either, although you may if you want.\r\n\r\n4. Please be sure your editor is using the UTF-8 encoding.\r\nFor instance, you could edit it as a response in this GitHub Issue ",

    "body": "Re 2) :  I downloaded ccsxml.zip from the CCS download page.  Extracting the zip leads to a folder 'xml'.\r\nThis folder contains several files, among which are ccshw2.txt and ccs.xml.\r\n\r\nccshw2.txt has as first few lines:\r\n```\r\n001-1:a:7,12\r\n001-1:a:13,32\r\n001-1:aMSa:33,43\r\n001-1:aMSakalpanA:44,49\r\n001-1:aMSaBAj:50,52\r\n001-1:aMSaBUta:53,57\r\n```\r\nEach line has three fields, separated by a colon ':'\r\n\r\nThe first field is the scan location.  The second field is the headword, coded in slp1, the third field contains the range of lines in ccs.txt that correspond to the headword.\r\n\r\nI tried to describe this in the developer documentation.\r\n\r\nIn ccs.xml, text which the digitization ccs.txt codes as {#X#}, with X in HK, is transformed to &lt;s&gt;Y&lt;/s&gt; with Y in SLP1.  Also, key1 is in slp1.  key2 is also in SLP1 for CCS (but I think this is not always the case for key2 in other dictionaries).\r\n\r\nSo, for instance,\r\n```\r\n<H1><h><key1>aMSuka</key1><key2>aMSuka</key2></h><body><s>aMSuka</s>¦  <i>n.</i> Gewand. <s>aMSukAnta</s> <i>m.</i> -zipfel.</body><tail><L>8</L><pc>001-1</pc></tail></H1>\r\n\r\n<key1>aMSuka</key1>   SLP1\r\n<key2>aMSuka</key2>  SLP1\r\n<s>aMSuka</s>  SLP1\r\n<s>aMSukAnta</s>  SLP1\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn CCS scans, I think Sanskrit words always appear in Devanagari. So, for CCS, the above scheme applies to all Sanskrit words.\r\n\r\nHowever, in some dictionaries,  Sanskrit words appear in IAST (of which there are several variations).   For IAST words in such dictionaries,  the words do NOT appear in SLP1 in the xml file, but appear in the AS encoding of IAST that Thomas invented.  \r\n\r\nThe exception to this last rule is MW; in the original MONIER.ALL, most of the IAST was converted to HK, and appears in the current mw.xml as &lt;s&gt;Y&lt;/s&gt; with Y in SLP1.  Interestingly, in MW72 the IAST is retained in the mw72.txt digitization, I think.\r\n\r\n4)  Yes, as mentioned, ccshw2.txt provides SLP1 headwords.\r\n\r\n4) 'adding markup will take too long' I agree.  That's why correcting first seems sensible.  \r\n\r\n3) German word extraction:   If you'll provide a German word list,  I'll extract the German words and work with you (since you know German) to get the German word spelling errors corrected.\r\n\r\n"
