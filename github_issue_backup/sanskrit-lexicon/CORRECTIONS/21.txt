    "body": "<b>The entries of MW are wrongly presented in the list here. For example, consider the first two:\r\nacCAi - अच्छाइ - Ai\r\nataUrDvam - अतऊर्ध्वम् - aU\r\nDefinitely MW does not write that way.\r\n</b>\r\nThis is precisely the reason why the words are in suspect list.\r\nThis issue is already raised <a href=\"https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/17\">here</a>.\r\nThe explanation is : All dictionaries here have key1 and key2. \r\nKey1 usually is without any marks. Key2 is exact reproduction of dictionary.\r\n\r\nBoth have their usefulness.\r\nLet's continue with your example.\r\nHere is the MW page of acCAi\r\n![capture](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5755132/4698954/2c760f3e-583b-11e4-97db-a7a5323ce6cf.PNG)\r\n\r\nIts key1 is 'acCAi'.\r\nIts key2 is 'a/cCA-i'.\r\n\r\nNo one would enter key2 = 'a/cCA-i' to check in an online dictionary.\r\nEveryone will enter without accent and without hyphen key1 = acCAi.\r\nTherefore both are retained.\r\nWhat we are checking right now is Key1.\r\nTherefore, it may seem that 'acCAi' is not what MW has written, still it makes sense for most of the people to have Key1 as first interaction. When that word is clicked - key2 is also displayed. So no information is lost.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Moreover, the suspect wrong words should not be listed just after getting the output from a computer, that does not understand anything, except 0 and 1.</b>\r\nI completely agree with you that comp understands only 0 and 1.\r\nBut it can help us reduce our burden by highlighting potentially wrong words, and it can do it unbiasedly. Human eyes usually overlook minor problems in data entry which their mind can supply.\r\nComputer can be a tool.\r\nUltimately it is the human which takes a decision whether the suspect word is correct or wrong.\r\n\r\n<b>BTW, if comparison has been made with वाचस्पत्यम्, the entries in the latter also should be given side by side. I do not have access to it.</b>\r\nWe can't do that. We are not comparing words with words.\r\nWe are comparing patterns with patterns.\r\nSo, there are no corresponding words.\r\nSecond thing - we are cleaning up MW and not vAcaspatyam. Therefore, we should read in MW to decide whether the word highlighted is right or wrong.\r\nIf right  - nothing remains to be done.\r\nIf wrong - submit correction.\r\n\r\nMethod:\r\n1. Click on the hyperlink\r\n2. Check the digital data of that word online\r\n3. If not satisfied, click on page number.\r\n4. This will open scanned page for that word.\r\n5. Read the scanned dictionary and decide whether it is an error or not\r\n6. If an error - paste it here.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Here's the reasoning\r\n\r\n1.  the text looks like ºbhâsya (?)and comes after -vi-krIqita (slp1).  matte-BAsya is alphabetically after matte-Ba-vi-krIqita, but matte-Ba-BAsya would be out of order.\r\n2.  The â  usually indicates a long 'A' formed by vowel sandhi; in this case of bha and maybe 'asya' (I'm not sure of 'asya', but MW has a (?) so maybe he's not sure of this either).  \r\n3.  The º usually means that this is not a compound of the implied 'parent' (matte-Ba)  if it were a compound of matte-Ba, then we would expect to text to show -bhâsya.\r\n\r\n Points 1 and 3 seem solid evidence in favor of no change.\r\n"

Don't let us forget it.\r\n\r\n@drdhaval2785  Perhaps faultfinder could be adapted to this purpose:\r\n\r\n Generate a list of Sanskrit words from the body of MW  (call it MWbodyslp.txt; I could do this.)  Then do a faultfinder with MWbodyslp.txt and MWslp.txt.  Would this generate useful list of possible errors in MWbodyslp.txt ?\r\n\r\nA variant of faultfinder would be needed to generate the links to MW headwords where the body words occur.  e.g., MWbodyslp.txt   lines would need form:\r\n```\r\nbodyword <headword where bodyword occurs>\r\n```\r\n"
