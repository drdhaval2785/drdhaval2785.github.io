The only place the old convention occurs is in monier.xml.\" is easily understandable and very fine standard. By far better than the old one.\r\nHave you opened the link I provided? If so, you would have seen the <a href=\"http://gasyoun.github.io/reverse20-ouput/key2/devanagarisorted3.html\">reversed list</a>. Everything that contains a number is an issue and I need to find a way to kill all the numbers, to find out why they are there at all.\r\n\"The underlying slp1 is kfzRO/ for key2, and you see how the '/' displays as a little vertical bar over the Devanagari for 'O' - in particular, there is no '/' in the devanagari. Of course, you may have intentionally left the '/' in the Devanagari for simplifying analysis.\" means that after converting \"slp1 is `kfzRO/` for key2\" to IAST (as per https://github.com/drdhaval2785/SanskritSorting/issues/16) I will get `kṛṣṅáu` and the Hex numbers will be gone? If there would be only a few of them I guess so, but there are plenty, that is why I ask if you might now what could they mean and where they are from.\r\nI want to have a clean list of reversed key2 entries from MW in IAST. Next step is to add the `lexgram` data but for that there needs to be a solution to https://github.com/funderburkjim/MWlexnorm/issues/1 but you have not yet commented on it, so it's stuck. Hope we can make it this week, so it can get into my PhD before it gets printed, thanks for reading."
