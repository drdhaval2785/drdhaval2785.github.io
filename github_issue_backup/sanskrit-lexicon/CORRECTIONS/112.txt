  "body": "I went through the exercise of generating faultfinder candidates for the 'headwords' of the grammar text KRM (Kṛdantarūpamālā).  120 cases resulted (out of about 2000 headwords).\r\n\r\nThe headwords are roots, in a DAtupAWa form. (Since MW does not present roots in this form, the\r\ncomparison is probably not too useful. A comparison with, say, Wilson, or  mADavIya DAtupAWa might be\r\nmore relevant.)\r\n\r\nI've glanced at the list, and think that there are no corrections to be made.\r\n\r\nFor the reference of others who may wish to examine the list, here are the two work documents:\r\n* [krm-fuzzyalpha.txt](https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/dictionaries/KRM/krm-fuzzyalpha.txt)\r\n* [krm-fuzzyalpha.html](http://funderburkjim.github.io/fuzzywork/krm-fuzzyalpha.html)\r\n",
