  "body": "6 cases were found by faultfinder for the headwords of PGN (Personal and Geographical Names in the Gupta Inscriptions)\r\n\r\nThese comprise headwords of  PGN that\r\n\r\n* occur only in PGN\r\n* have spelling patterns that \r\n  * don't occur among the MW headwords (as detected from faultfinder),\r\n  * are not of the 'rxx' variety.\r\n\r\nI've put pgn-fuzzyalpha.txt [here](https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/dictionaries/PGN/pgn-fuzzyalpha.txt)  and pgn-fuzzyalpha.html as active html page [here](http://funderburkjim.github.io/fuzzywork/pgn-fuzzyalpha.html).\r\n\r\nThe instructions are as per [issue 100](https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/100).\r\n\r\n@Shalu411  This would be a good one for you to do.  It is a short list and won't take much time.  And, it will give you the opportunity to get the technical details worked out.\r\n\r\nBasically, you are going to 'complete' the pgn-fuzzyalpha.txt file,  using the links in pgn-fuzzyalpha.html (mostly the page links) to help you see what's going on.  To 'complete' the .txt file,  first download it (right click on link above to pgn-fuzzalpha.txt, and 'save as' to a local file).  Then change this local copy and, when you're done, upload somewhere in the cloud (Dropbox is fine) and mention the link to upload location in a comment in this issue.  I'll grab your corrected file, and do the installation on the Cologne server.\r\n\r\nAs to the format expected in your corrected pgn-fuzzyalpha.txt,  see Dhaval's instructions;  you might also \r\nwant to look at Dhaval's completed file [vei-fuzzyalpha-completed.txt](https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/dictionaries/VEI/vei-fuzzyalpha-completed.txt).\r\n\r\nLots of little details, but not too hard once you've done it once or twice. :sunglasses: \r\n",

    "body": "@gasyoun \r\n`Why some are in () only?`  All suggestions, whether in parens or no,  are words in some dictionary that are \r\n   within a certain edit distance of the word in question (samudragupwa in case 001 of pgn-fuzzyalpha.txt).\r\n   samudragupta is a word in some dictionary which has a close spelling to samudragupwa,  so \r\n   sumdragupta qualifies as a suggestion.   NOW  imagine we have a list of all suggestions *based on edit\r\n   distance* criterion.   This list is further analyzed into two sublists, based on the preceding and succeeding\r\n   headword  (in case 001 of PGN,  the preceding headword is candragupta, and the following headword is\r\n   also candragupta -  unusual they are the same.)   If a given suggestion is alphabetically between the\r\n   preceeding and following headword, then that suggestion goes in non-parenthesized list;  if the suggestion\r\n   fails to be alphabetically between, then that suggestion goes in the parenthesized list.  \r\n\r\n`Why some () are empty?`    There are no suggestions that are NOT in alphabetical order.  E.g., in case 003\r\n   there is just one suggestion Suklakarmman  and it is alphabetically between ruzwaSarmman and \r\n   suSarmman,  so Suklakarmman   was put outside (), and there was no other suggestion that could go in\r\n   ()\r\n\r\n`Should we have such a big fuzzy distance?`   There is no easy answer to this question.  The edit-distance\r\n  maximum edit distance parameter used in the PGN fuzzyalpha.py program was 6.   This generates some\r\n  false positives (bad suggestions).    I don't know if there is a 'best' edit distance threshold. \r\n"

    "body": "There is two other details of the suggestion generation that is incorporated in fuzzyalpha.py.  \r\n Suppose that the fuzzy distance parameter is set to 6.   And suppose our base word is X (like samudragupwa \r\n is case 001 of PGN).  Our initial pool of candidates for suggestions, Y, is all 300,000+ words in sanhw1.txt.\r\n \r\n* An accepted suggestion Y must have the same first letter as X  (e.g., Y must start with 's')\r\n* Once we have the set S of all words Y which have the same first letter as X and whose edit distance from\r\n   X is <=6,  then this suggestion list is further reduced to include only those Y in S which have the minimum\r\n   edit distance from X.   To elaborate:  Suppose the edit distances from X happen to be 3 for some Y in S,\r\n   4 for some other Y in S, and 6 for other Y in S.   Then the FINAL suggestion list will only include those \r\n   Y with edit distance of 3.\r\n\r\nThe first condition was chosen to provide some computational efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe second condition was chosen as a way to prune the list of suggestions (so that list would not be too long).\r\n\r\nThese choices could be debated,  but, for our purposes in generating correction suggestions they seem to \r\nbe plausible.\r\n"

    "body": "@gasyoun Re 5). PD\r\n\r\nI've generated pd-fuzzyalpha , 1158 cases.  Review of a random selection of these makes me think that\r\n THERE ARE ALMOST NO ERRORS.   Rather,  I suspect these cases are simply due to the great number\r\nof compound words in PD that do not appear in MW.  Take `agnicEtanya` as an example.  Both `agni` and\r\n`cEtanya` are words appearing in MW, but the compound word does not appear, and the `icE` sequence\r\nappearing in this compound does not appear in any MW word.\r\n\r\nI think a different approach should be used to examine this PD faultfinder list.  The reason is that 1158 cases\r\nis, practically speaking, a large list to check manually against scans.\r\n\r\nOne different approach would be for\r\none of our Sanskrit experts simply to read each word in the list and judge whether the word is *obviously* a\r\ncorrect Sanskrit word (I suspect this will be true in 90% of the cases), or whether the word needs further\r\nexamination.  Then, the words marked for further examination can be examined 'manually' by comparison\r\nto the scanned images.\r\n\r\nAnother possible approach would be to write a program to identify  the words which are (like agnicEtanya)\r\ncompounds of MW headwords.  Here's how the program could work. The program could successively try\r\nall 2-fold partitions of the word, for instance \r\na+gnicEtanya, ag + nicEtanya, agn+icEtanya, agni+cEtanya, agnic+Etanya  ... agnicEtany + a\r\nand, for a given partition, check if both components are MW headwords.  If so, the given word would be\r\nmarked as OK.   The remaining words (those not marked as OK) would need further review, either by\r\nSanskrit experts, or manually by comparison to scan.\r\nNote: This mechanical partition is simple-minded, that's why it would be a good first thing to try. One weakness of the mechanical partition approach is that it does not take into account sandhi that can occur\r\nin compounds when combining nominal stems.  For instance, the word `akzIRendu` occurs among the \r\n1158 PD cases.  This is likely a compound of akzIRa and indu, (both MW stems) but this fact would not\r\nbe found by the mechanical partition approach.\r\n\r\n"

    "body": "@funderburkjim the non-appearance of `agnicEtanya` in MW is understood. PD initial goal was to list all the possible combinations, MW wanted to keep the bricks separately so he has only `agni` and `cEtanya`. At the end of the day PD failed and the dictionary will be never finished. As a part of the initial goal in Pune I plan to print the total index of all the 430k wordforms found in Sanskrit dictionaries to see if it has any practical usage.\r\n1k+ cases is a list too big indeed, just to test.\r\n`One different approach` does not makes sense - it would bring as to the Bronze Age (pre-2014). It would make sense only if @drdhaval2785 would create a sister to his sandhi generator and analyze the words and mark the ones which are fishy at least from the phonetics standpoint. \r\n`Another possible approach` seems to be more promising. The fact is such a program is already written and used at http://sanskrit.inria.fr/MW/90.html#ciraprasuutaa In 2013 Gérard Huet wrote: `I know how to split arbitrary compounds. So the lexicalized entries do not matter that much, except for looking up their definitions, of course.`\r\nIt's too bad Huet's code is closed, he said it took them 6 months to make the `mechanical partition is simple-minded` process with Pawan Goyal a little more smarter. The sandhi part is rather stupid in Huet's splitting of samasas as well, actually. This is where @drdhaval2785 or @mbykov code could come handy."
