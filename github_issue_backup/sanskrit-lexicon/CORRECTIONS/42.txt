  "body": "This is a continuation of the discussion beginning 3 days ago in https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/issues/39.\r\n\r\nThere are two dropbox links:\r\na. faultfinder3a at  https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29859999/AllvsMW.zip\r\n\r\nb. sanhw1 at https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/29859999/sanhw1.zip\r\n\r\n<H2> refactoring faultfinder3 </H2>\r\nfaultfinder3a.php now is a command-line program which creates a <b>text</b> file.  Then,\r\nfaultfinder3a-html.php creates an html file based on the text file.\r\nHere's the invocation used:\r\n```\r\nphp faultfinder3a.php MW sanhw1.txt AllvsMW.txt\r\nphp faultfinder3a-html.php AllvsMW.txt AllvsMW-new.html\r\n```\r\nThe text output AllvsMW.txt contains lines like:\r\n```\r\nSIrzaCeda:VCV=aCe:WIL,YAT\r\n```\r\nThis shows the suspect headword and the dictionaries it is in. Also, the middle field \r\nshows  the pattern-abbreviation-type (VCV) = actual-pattern-in-word (aCe).\r\nIt should now be easy to <b>filter</b> this text file in various ways to generate more manageable\r\nchunks; For example, I think most of the rxx words are not errors, but occur simply due to a spelling\r\nconvention that MW does not follow (MW being the reference dictionary here);  nearly half of the 9399 lines of AllvsMW.txt are of the rxx type, so this seems a useful reduction of the problem. This is\r\njust one example of how the huge problem can be reduced by this refactoring.\r\n\r\nAnother filter would be to look for words which occur ONLY in one dictionary; e.g, there are 375\r\nsuch for Wilson, 230 such for MW72, 456 for CCS, only 23 remaining in CAE, etc.  \r\n\r\n<i>We can use this issue to develop a list of useful filtered lists, and then begin working with the .html files for the various lists.</i>\r\n\r\nSmaller refactorings:\r\na. The only data source is sanhw1.txt.  The list of reference headwords (for MW in the example) are \r\nobtained from sanhw1.txt, rather than from a separate MWslp.txt file.\r\nb. The pattern and hrefyear data have been moved to a utility file faultfinder3a_utils.php, which\r\n   is included in the two main php programs.  The pattern data has also been put into a structure\r\n   which should be easier to modify, and is easier to understand.\r\nc. In faultfinder3a-html.php,  the links in the output were generated via Javascript as buttons.  This\r\n also makes the html file size smaller, and helps localize the programmatic construction of the links.\r\n\r\n<H2> change sort order in sanhw1 </H2>\r\nIn response to a request elsewhere,  I have changed the sort order appearing in sanhw1.txt.\r\nNow,  M+Consonant sorts as if it were N+Consonant, where N is the nasal for the varga of the\r\nConsonant; (this does not apply to consonants yrlvSzsh; M before these consonants is unchanged\r\nfor sorting).\r\n\r\nAlso, by redoing sanhw1, the list is several hundred less than a week ago, due to the many CAE and other headword corrections.\r\n\r\n",

I informally use this to screen out no-error headwords. Logic is if a word is there in more than one dictionary, chances are less that it may be a wrong word. Makes sense.\r\n\r\n```Smaller refactorings:\r\na. The only data source is sanhw1.txt.

They are great additions / alterations.\r\n"

    "body": "@funderburkjim well done, as usual. A few questions / thoughts before going to sleep, converted to .xls https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/AllvsMW.xls.\r\n1) \"nearly half of the 9399 lines of AllvsMW.txt are of the rxx type\" there is no easy way to sort out the \"rxx type\" now.\r\n```\r\nsOvOryya\tsauvauryya\tVCV\tOvO\tSHS\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan be found only by `OvO` and not by `ryy` or even `RCC` pattern - that would be even better. We have to develop rules and triggers. To have just `CCC` would not tell much, but `RCC` change the game. `ryy` or `rll` does not matters much, hope both of you will agree. It's only about the structure.\r\n\r\n2) \"look for words which occur ONLY in one dictionary\" - it's something I and Dhaval have done in the past. I would only think that there should be an additional column counting the number of sources and using color formatting in .xls or .html. Sorting the number of sources is great? Guess no, alphabetical order has it's good sides. Dhaval, would it help to have the ones which have only one source with a yellow background?\r\nIf only SKD and VCP has a word which none others have that might be fishy as well, so even if there are two (similar), that still should trigger another rule. Like only Indian dictionaries or Indian and European sources.\r\n\r\n3) I can read VCCCCCV pattern, but I need to know if S in SCC is a real life `s`? Or CCE - never seen and do not thing vowels should be differentiated in our case.\r\n\r\n4) \"But as many dictionaries have used this convention - doesn't seem great idea to change them to 't'. But access to data should be there for sure.\" - it's Boethlink's approach, he is guilty for it all. It's called European linguistics. So I guess interlinking takes this task too far. Than we have interlink much more and it grows in something gigantic which I think we are not yet ready to approach even.\r\n\r\n5) Please make a repository or upload to an existing one the valuable sanhw1.zip file. Dropbox is for experiments. sanhw1.zip is no longer such, it's a huge step for mankind. Let it have it's legal place."

Since i am responsible currently for maintaining Corrections,  this would be straightforward.

I changed only one line in the program, line 228\r\n```\r\n                    fputs($outfile,givelink($dictdata[$j],$worddata[$j]).\"</br>\\n\");\r\n```\r\nadding the '\\n'  so the output file would have separate lines. In this rerun, only 16 lines have an 'ant ', in close agreement with AllvsMW.txt.   This run uses the new version of sanhw1 (which has 2000+ 'ant' words), and the same MWslp.txt.   \r\n\r\nProbably there was some oddity in the run that generated the ants in AllvsMW.html, and its  not worth spending the time to try to understand that oddity by doing a git rollback.\r\n"

I had not known it existed.\r\n Ditto for the markup\r\n```\r\n[here](url)\r\n```\r\n\r\n I would have factored things a bit differently, but yours works, so its mostly a difference in styles:\r\n```\r\nphp faultfinder3a.php MW sanhw1.txt AllvsMW.txt\r\nphp dictwisesorter-vx.php AllvsMW.txt AllvsMW-norepeat.txt   <-- same format as AllvsMW.txt -->\r\nphp faultfinder3a-html.php AllvsMW-norepeat.txt dictwiseerrors3-table.html   1\r\n   add option to faultfinder3a-html to output in tabular form.  Do the IAST and pattern-highlighting here\r\n```\r\nYou could leave the javascript, and still get the effect you prefer:\r\n```\r\nInstead of\r\nwindow.open(href,\\\"dictionary\\\");\r\nUse\r\nwindow.open(href,\\\"_blank\\\");\r\n```\r\n The w3schools site has excellent information on how to do things with html, css, javascript, etc.\r\nincluding [Html tables](http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp).\r\n"
