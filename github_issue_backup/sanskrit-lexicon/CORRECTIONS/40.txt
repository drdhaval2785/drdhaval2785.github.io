This kind of exercise helps increase one's Sanskrit vocabulary. In occasional doses, it is even fun.  Coding is fun, but less helpful in increasing Sanskrit knowledge. I do concur that our digitization of CAE (one of the early digitizations) is quite dirty.  And I'll probably switch to some other dictionary shortly.  Just because 'an Indian proofreader <b>could</b>' do this  (which I agree), does not mean that one is presently available.  "
