  "body": "Jim -\r\nRe: 28 svArmODna -> svAmOrDna\r\nDid NOT change.\r\n(a) The text appears to have the 'r' over the 'm', not over the 'Dn'\r\n(b) By alphabetical ordering in PW (using list display), we see\r\nsvArdra , svArmODna , svAlakzaRa\r\nSo, 'svArm...' is correctly placed.\r\n\r\n@drdhaval2785 :\r\nExplanation to 28\r\nPlease look at the image once again.\r\nI can't read the explanation because of language barrier.\r\nBut I can read a sanskrit word -mOrDna at the end of the explanation.\r\nMaybe you should reconsider your view.\r\nThe digitization is proper as per print.\r\nBut svArmODna is not possible according to grammar.\r\nmOrDna can be derived from mUrDan. So svArmODna is the only legitimate choice.\r\n\r\n@funderburkjim :\r\nI agree that -mOrDna is at the end of the explanation.\r\nI don't read German either, but using Google Translate can get an idea of the sense.\r\nverdorben == spoiled (Incidentally, this seems completely unrelated to mUrDan!)\r\nVielleicht *mOrDna zu lesen == Perhaps *mOrDna to read.\r\nI also see in the scan at the headword, svArmODna, and the alphabetical fact is present.\r\nSo, it seems the author is spelling the headword as given : svArmODna; If we had the reference Kath.18,12 that the author had, then we might see this spelling.\r\nHowever, with the 'Perhaps to read' statement the author is , in effect, agreeing with your analysis of the underlying Sanskrit and saying that maybe it should have been svAmOrDna.\r\nSo, I'm still not convinced that the headword should be changed.",

We have fixed hundreds of mistakes in the printed book itself by now I guess. So grammar is of much more interest to us.\r\n\r\n@funderburkjim \r\n```\r\nverdorben == spoiled (Incidentally, this seems completely unrelated to mUrDan!)\r\nVielleicht *mOrDna zu lesen == Perhaps *mOrDna to read.\r\n```\r\nIs correctly translated. I can read German fairly well. \r\nAs per \"So, I'm still not convinced that the headword should be changed.\" - if there is a ghost-headword `svAmOrDna`, than we can (and should) leave the wrong one, because the formulation `zu lesen` is equal as statement of it's `fehlerhaft-ness`. So I made a collection https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/PWK-zu-lesen-325.txt - these cases have been noted by Boethlingk himself as potentially bad."
