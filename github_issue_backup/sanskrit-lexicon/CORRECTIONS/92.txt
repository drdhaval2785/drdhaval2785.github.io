  "body": "There are 89 cases of missing data in the digitization of INM (Index to Names in the Mahabharata, by S. Sorensen).   These are detailed [here](https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/CORRECTIONS/blob/master/dictionaries/INM/missing_0001-0099.txt)\r\n\r\nIf anyone wants to tackle these, I can supply the fairly simple instructions.  Basically, you have to look at\r\neach case, and, by some means (such as examination of scan or the print version of text), determine what\r\nthe missing text should be, and input that and your initials in the line **below** the <b>&lt;orig&gt;</b> line in the file above.  When all the corrections are accounted for, I have a program to process the adjusted file and install the corrections.\r\n\r\nA first glance at a couple of examples suggests that this might be hard from our scans alone; so probably reference to a better-printed paper version will be needed -- but this is just a guess.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "I hardly believe that other, printed copies will help. I have none, but still in some cases I understand that what we need to do is decipherment, using some kind of prior knowledge or logic. In case of missing numbers we need a scholar interested in the Epics who has the printed editions to restore them - that means we need to make a smaller list where the numbers only in paragraphs are missing. Slowly I can look at them, to see if I can help at all. Not all cases are hopeless. As you will see in case of `agastya` - it's just some guesswork, but the result is 100% correct. What about the scholar with knowledge of Greek - I see a lot of Greek text. Can we approach him, can we ask for help?\r\n\r\naSlezA\r\n![004](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/80761/6764010/02100b1e-cfaa-11e4-9ef5-6ebad58a2b83.PNG)\r\n\r\naSvatTAman\r\n![10](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/80761/6764015/edef86ae-cfaa-11e4-9b86-83f0737529ae.PNG)\r\n\r\nagastya\r\n![016](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/80761/6764035/01cdf916-cfac-11e4-8041-c91fad86e148.PNG)\r\n\r\n [Footnote: *1) Natus erat cum fratre Vasishtho semine Mitri et Varuni, q{??} \r\nUrvaçīm vidissent, amore incensorum in urceum profluente (Bṛ{??} \r\n5. 30 ff., see BR.).] \r\n\r\n [Footnote: *1) Natus erat cum fratre Vasishtho semine Mitri et Varuni, quum nympham\r\nUrvaçīm vidissent, amore incensorum in urceum profluente (Bṛhaddevatā,\r\n5. 30 ff., see BR.).] \r\n\r\n`(Bṛhad-devatā literally means 'a big work dealing with the Vedic deities'.)`"
