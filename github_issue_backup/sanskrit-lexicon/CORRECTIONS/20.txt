    "body": "Viewing the entry 'dASa' (slp1) in  Monier, 1899,  I don't see 'dāś2a'.\r\n\r\nThe following is a grep search of key2 in mw.xml for cases where a number is part of the key2 content;  no cases were found:\r\n```\r\ngrep '<key2>.*[0-9].*</key2>' mw.xml\r\n```\r\nand found no results.\r\n\r\nIncidental note1:  A version of the unix 'grep' utility, and also some other unix utilities, is available for Windows in the command shell Git Bash. I have used both http://git-scm.com/downloads and https://openhatch.org/missions/windows-setup/install-git-bash as sources for downloading and installing git bash\r\nIncidental note2:  I first wrote the grep regexp as:\r\n```\r\ngrep '<key2>.*?[0-9].*?</key2>' mw.xml\r\n```\r\nThe '?' means non-greedy match. I learned from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19125173/non-greedy-matching-using-with-grep that non-greedy matching with '?' is a Perl convention. And the version of grep in git-bash (that I am using) does not support the '-P' option.  Thus, I removed the '?' in the example.  However, the version of grep on the Cologne servers does support the '-P' option.\r\nMoral:  regex searches are somewhat implementation specific.\r\nIn php, the 'preg_search' and 'preg_replace' functions are modeled after the Perl regular expressions; so, in particular, using the '?' for non-greedy searches/replacements works fine.\r\n\r\n"
