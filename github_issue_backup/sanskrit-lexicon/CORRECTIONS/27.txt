    "body": "I concur with this observation.  \r\nHere is a bit of history regarding the MW supplement.\r\n\r\nThese additions/corrections records were originally in a separately digitized file, MONIER.ADD from Thomas. This file is about 400k.\r\n\r\nThey were 'tacked on the end'  (With Lnumbers 300000-399999) of monier.xml in 2010.  This also involved converting the form from that of MONIER.ADD to that of monier.xml.  I probably did this.\r\n\r\n\r\nin 2012,  work by Peter Scharf, Pawan Goyal, and Sharon Ben-Dor (a former student of Peter) permitted the integration of the supplement into the body of monier.xml.  Essentially, this involved identifying &lt;Hx&gt; codes and appropriate new Lnumbers for the supplement records. The coding was done in such a way that it is possible to identify records that originated in the supplement.  As I recall, this is by means of an attribute of the Lnumber element.\r\n\r\nThus, it is likely possible to extract, in supplement order, the records of mw.xml that originated from the supplement.  Then, someone could read these records in relation to the scans.  \r\nI count 6602 records in mw.xml matching '&lt;L ' ; 6397 of these are of form &lt;L supL=\"X\"&gt;  and the rest are &lt;L revL=\"X\"&gt;  indicating supplements (additions) and revisions, respectively. There about 25.5 scan pages involved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
